come my coach good night ladies good night sweet ladies good night good night part one one thirty or forty years ago in one of those grey towns along the burlington railroad which are so much greyer today than they were then there was a house well known from omaha to denver for its hospitality and for a certain charm of atmosphere well known that is to say to the railroad aristocracy of that time men who had to do with the railroad itself or with one of the land companies which were its byproducts in those days it was enough to say of a man that he was connected with the burlington there were the directors the general managers vicepresidents superintendents whose names we all knew and their younger brothers or nephews were auditors freight agents departmental assistants everyone connected with the road even the large cattle and grainshippers had annual passes they and their families rode about over the line a great deal there were then two distinct social strata in the prairie states the homesteaders and handworkers who were there to make a living and the bankers and gentlemen ranchers who came from the atlantic seaboard to invest money and to develop our great west as they used to tell us when the burlington men were travelling back and forth on business not very urgent they found it agreeable to drop off the express and spend a night in a pleasant house where their importance was delicately recognized and no house was pleasanter than that of captain daniel forrester at sweet water captain forrester was himself a railroad man a contractor who had built hundreds of miles of road for the burlingtonover the sage brush and cattle country and on up into the black hills the forrester place as every one called it was not at all remarkable the people who lived there made it seem much larger and finer than it was the house stood on a low round hill nearly a mile east of town a white house with a wing and sharpsloping roofs to shed the snow it was encircled by porches too narrow for modern notions of comfort supported by the fussy fragile pillars of that time when every honest stick of timber was tortured by the turninglathe into something hideous stripped of its vines and denuded of its shrubbery the house would probably have been ugly enough it stood close into a fine cottonwood grove that threw sheltering arms to left and right and grew all down the hillside behind it thus placed on the hill against its bristling grove it was the first thing one saw on coming into sweet water by rail and the last thing one saw on departing to approach captain forresters property you had first to get over a wide sandy creek which flowed along the eastern edge of the town crossing this by the footbridge or the ford you entered the captains private lane bordered by lombardy poplars with wide meadows lying on either side just at the foot of the hill on which the house sat one crossed a second creek by the stout wooden roadbridge this stream traced artless loops and curves through the broad meadows that were half pasture land half marsh any one but captain forrester would have drained the bottom land and made it into highly productive fields but he had selected this place long ago because it looked beautiful to him and he happened to like the way the creek wound through his pasture with mint and jointgrass and twinkling willows along its banks he was well off for those times and he had no children he could afford to humour his fancies when the captain drove friends from omaha or denver over from the station in his democrat wagon it gratified him to hear these gentlemen admire his fine stock grazing in the meadows on either side of his lane and when they reached the top of the hill it gratified him to see men who were older than himself leap nimbly to the ground and run up the front steps as mrs forrester came out on the porch to greet them even the hardest and coldest of his friends a certain narrowfaced lincoln banker became animated when he took her hand tried to meet the gay challenge in her eyes and to reply cleverly to the droll word of greeting on her lips she was always there just outside the front door to welcome their visitors having been warned of their approach by the sound of hoofs and the rumble of wheels on the wooden bridge if she happened to be in the kitchen helping her bohemian cook she came out in her apron waving a buttery iron spoon or shook cherry stained fingers at the new arrival she never stopped to pin up a lock she was attractive in dishabille and she knew it she had been known to rush to the door in her dressinggown brush in hand and her long black hair rippling over her shoulders to welcome cyrus dalzell president of the colorado utah and the great man had never felt more flattered in his eyes and in the eyes of the admiring middleaged men who visited there whatever mrs forrester chose to do was ladylike because she did it they could not imagine her in any dress or situation in which she would not be charming captain forrester himself a man of few words told judge pommeroy that he had never seen her look more captivating than on the day when she was chased by the new bull in the pasture she had forgotten about the bull and gone into the meadow to gather wild flowers he heard her scream and as he ran puffing down the hill she was scudding along the edge of the marshes like a hare beside herself with laughter and stubbornly clinging to the crimson parasol that had made all the trouble mrs forrester was twentyfive years younger than her husband and she was his second wife he married her in california and brought her to sweet water a bride they called the place home even then when they lived there but a few months out of each year but later after the captains terrible fall with his horse in the mountains which broke him so that he could no longer build railroads he and his wife retired to the house on the hill he grew old thereand even she alas grew older two but we will begin this story with a summer morning long ago when mrs forrester was still a young woman and sweet water was a town of which great things were expected that morning she was standing in the deep baywindow of her parlour arranging oldfashioned blush roses in a glass bowl glancing up she saw a group of little boys coming along the driveway barefoot with fishingpoles and lunchbaskets she knew most of them there was niel herbert judge pommeroys nephew a handsome boy of twelve whom she liked and polite george adams son of a gentleman rancher from lowell massachusetts the others were just little boys from the town the butchers redheaded son the leading grocers fat brown twins ed elliott whose flirtatious old father kept a shoe store and was the don juan of the lower world of sweet water and the two sons of the german tailorpale freckled lads with ragged clothes and ragged rustcoloured hair from whom she sometimes bought game or catfish when they appeared silent and spooklike at her kitchen door and thinly asked if she would care for any fish this morning as the boys came up the hill she saw them hesitate and consult together you ask her niel youd better george she goes to your house all the time and she barely knows me to speak to as they paused before the three steps which led up to the front porch mrs forrester came to the door and nodded graciously one of the pink roses in her hand goodmorning boys off for a picnic george adams stepped forward and solemnly took off his big straw hat goodmorning mrs forrester please may we fish and wade down in the marsh and have our lunch in the grove certainly you have a lovely day how long has school been out dont you miss it im sure niel does judge pommeroy tells me hes very studious the boys laughed and niel looked unhappy run along and be sure you dont leave the gate into the pasture open mr forrester hates to have the cattle get in on his blue grass the boys went quietly round the house to the gate into the grove then ran shouting down the grassy slopes under the tall trees mrs forrester watched them from the kitchen window until they disappeared behind the roll of the hill she turned to her bohemian cook mary when you are baking this morning put in a pan of cookies for those boys ill take them down when they are having their lunch the round hill on which the forrester house stood sloped gently down to the bridge in front and gently down through the grove behind but east of the house where the grove ended it broke steeply from high grassy banks like bluffs to the marsh below it was thither the boys were bound when lunch time came they had done none of the things they meant to do they had behaved like wild creatures all morning shouting from the breezy bluffs dashing down into the silvery marsh through the dewy cobwebs that glistened on the tall weeds swishing among the pale tan cattails wading in the sandy creek bed chasing a striped water snake from the old willow stump where he was sunning himself cutting slingshot crotches throwing themselves on their stomachs to drink at the cool spring that flowed out from under a bank into a thatch of dark watercress only the two german boys rheinhold and adolph blum withdrew to a still pool where the creek was dammed by a reclining tree trunk and in spite of all the noise and splashing about them managed to catch a few suckers the wild roses were wide open and brilliant the blueeyed grass was in purple flower and the silvery milkweed was just coming on birds and butterflies darted everywhere all at once the breeze died the air grew very hot the marsh steamed and the birds disappeared the boys found they were tired their shirts stuck to their bodies and their hair to their foreheads they left the sweltering marshmeadows for the grove lay down on the clean grass under the grateful shade of the tall cottonwoods and spread out their lunch the blum boys never brought anything but rye bread and hunks of dry cheesetheir companions wouldnt have touched it on any account but thaddeus grimes the butchers redheaded son was the only one impolite enough to show his scorn you live on wienies to home why dont you never bring none he bawled hush said niel herbert he pointed to a white figure coming rapidly down through the grove under the flickering leaf shadows mrs forrester bareheaded a basket on her arm her blueblack hair shining in the sun it was not until years afterward that she began to wear veils and sun hats though her complexion was never one of her beauties her cheeks were pale and rather thin slightly freckled in summer as she approached george adams who had a particular mother rose and niel followed his example here are some hot cookies for your lunch boys she took the napkin off the basket did you catch anything we didnt fish much just ran about said george i know you were wading and things she had a nice way of talking to boys light and confidential i wade down there myself sometimes when i go down to get flowers i cant resist it i pull off my stockings and pick up my skirts and in i go she thrust out a white shoe and shook it but you can swim cant you mrs forrester said george most women cant oh yes they can in california everybody swims but the sweet water doesnt tempt memud and water snakes and bloodsuckers ugh she shivered laughing we seen a water snake this morning and chased him a whopper thad grimes put in why didnt you kill him next time i go wading hell bite my toes now go on with your lunch george can leave the basket with mary as you go out she left them and they watched her white figure drifting along the edge of the grove as she stopped here and there to examine the raspberry vines by the fence these are good cookies all right said one of the giggly brown weaver twins the german boys munched in silence they were all rather pleased that mrs forrester had come down to them herself instead of sending mary even rough little thad grimes with his red thatch and catfish mouththe characteristic feature of all the grimes broodknew that mrs forrester was a very special kind of person george and niel were already old enough to see for themselves that she was different from the other townswomen and to reflect upon what it was that made her so the blum brothers regarded her humbly from under their pale chewedoff hair as one of the rich and great of the world they realized more than their companions that such a fortunate and privileged class was an axiomatic fact in the social order the boys had finished their lunch and were lying on the grass talking about how judge pommeroys water spaniel fanny had been poisoned and who had certainly done it when they had a second visitor shut up boys there he comes now thats poison ivy said one of the weaver twins shut up we dont want old roger poisoned a wellgrown boy of eighteen or nineteen dressed in a shabby corduroy hunting suit with a gun and gamebag had climbed up from the marsh and was coming down the grove between the rows of trees he walked with a rude arrogant stride kicking at the twigs and carried himself with unnatural erectness as if he had a steel rod down his back there was something defiant and suspicious about the way he held his head he came up to the group and addressed them in a superior patronizing tone hullo kids what are you doing here picnic said ed elliott i thought girls went on picnics did you bring teacher along aint you kids old enough to hunt yet george adams looked at him scornfully of course we are i got a 22 remington for my last birthday but we know better than to bring guns over here you better hide yours mr ivy or mrs forrester will come down and tell you to get out she cant see us from the house and anyhow she cant say anything to me im just as good as she is to this the boys made no reply such an assertion was absurd even to fishmouthed thad his fathers business depended upon some people being better than others and ordering better cuts of meat in consequence if everybody ate round steak like ivy peters family there would be nothing in the butchers trade the visitor had put his gun and gamebag behind a tree however and stood stiffly upright surveying the group out of his narrow beady eyes and making them all uncomfortable george and niel hated to look at ivyand yet his face had a kind of fascination for them it was red and the flesh looked hard as if it were swollen from beestings or from an encounter with poison ivy this nickname however was given him because it was well known that he had made away with several other dogs before he had poisoned the judges friendly water spaniel the boys said he took a dislike to a dog and couldnt rest until he made an end of him ivys red skin was flecked with tiny freckles like rust spots and in each of his hard cheeks there was a curly indentation like a knot in a treeboletwo permanent dimples which did anything but soften his countenance his eyes were very small and an absence of eyelashes gave his pupils the fixed unblinking hardness of a snakes or a lizards his hands had the same swollen look as his face were deeply creased across the back and knuckles as if the skin were stretched too tight he was an ugly fellow ivy peters and he liked being ugly he began telling the boys that it was too hot to hunt now but later he meant to steal down to the marsh where the ducks came at sundown and bag a few i can make off across the corn fields before the old cap sees me hes not much on the run hell complain to your father a whoop my father cares the speakers restless eyes were looking up through the branches see that woodpecker tapping dont mind us a bit thats nerve they are protected here so theyre not afraid said precise george hump theyll spoil the old mans grove for him that trees full of holes already wouldnt he come down easy now niel and george adams sat up dont you dare shoot here youll get us all into trouble shed come right down from the house cried ed elliott let her come stuckup piece whos talking about shooting anyway theres more ways of killing dogs than choking them with butter at this effrontery the boys shot amazed glances at one another and the brown weaver twins broke simultaneously into giggles and rolled over on the turf but ivy seemed unaware that he was regarded as being especially resourceful where dogs were concerned he drew from his pocket a metal slingshot and some round bits of gravel i wont kill it ill just surprise it so we can have a look at it bet you wont hit it bet i will he fitted the stone to the leather squinted and let fly sure enough the woodpecker dropped at his feet he threw his heavy black felt hat over it ivy never wore a straw hat even in the hottest weather now wait hell come to youll hear him flutter in a minute it aint a he anyhow its a female anybody would know that said niel contemptuously annoyed that this unpopular boy should come along and spoil their afternoon he held the fate of his uncles spaniel against ivy peters all right miss female said ivy carelessly intent upon a project of his own he took from his pocket a little red leather box and when he opened it the boys saw that it contained curious little instruments tiny sharp knife blades hooks curved needles a saw a blowpipe and scissors some of these i got with a taxidermy outfit from the youths companion and some i made myself he got stiffly down on his kneeshis joints seemed disinclined to bend at alland listened beside his hat shes as lively as a cricket he announced thrusting his hand suddenly under the brim he brought out the startled bird it was not bleeding and did not seem to be crippled now you watch and ill show you something said ivy he held the woodpeckers head in a vice made of his thumb and forefinger enclosing its panting body with his palm quick as a flash as if it were a practised trick with one of those tiny blades he slit both the eyes that glared in the birds stupid little head and instantly released it the woodpecker rose in the air with a whirling corkscrew motion darted to the right struck a treetrunkto the left and struck another up and down backward and forward among the tangle of branches it flew raking its feathers falling and recovering itself the boys stood watching it indignant and uncomfortable not knowing what to do they were not especially sensitive thad was always on hand when there was anything doing at the slaughter house and the blum boys lived by killing things they wouldnt have believed they could be so upset by a hurt woodpecker there was something wild and desperate about the way the darkened creature beat its wings in the branches whirling in the sunlight and never seeing it always thrusting its head up and shaking it as a bird does when it is drinking presently it managed to get its feet on the same limb where it had been struck and seemed to recognize that perch as if it had learned something by its bruises it pecked and crept its way along the branch and disappeared into its own hole there niel herbert exclaimed between his teeth if i can get it now i can kill it and put it out of its misery let me on your back rhein rheinhold was the tallest and he obediently bent his bony back the trunk of a cottonwood tree is hard to climb the bark is rough and the branches begin a long way up niel tore his trousers and scratched his bare legs smartly before he got to the first fork after recovering breath he wound his way up toward the woodpeckers hole which was inconveniently high he was almost there his companions below thought him quite safe when he suddenly lost his balance turned a somersault in the air and bumped down on the grass at their feet there he lay without moving run for water run for mrs forrester ask her for whiskey no said george adams lets carry him up to the house she will know what to do thats sense said ivy peters as he was much bigger and stronger than any of the others he lifted niels limp body and started up the hill it had occurred to him that this would be a fine chance to get inside the forresters house and see what it was like and this he had always wanted to do mary the cook saw them coming from the kitchen window and ran for her mistress captain forrester was in kansas city that day mrs forrester came to the back door whats happened its niel too bring him in this way please ivy peters followed her keeping his eyes open and the rest trooped after himall but the blum boys who knew that their place was outside the kitchen door mrs forrester led the way through the butlers pantry the diningroom the back parlour to her own bedroom she threw down the white counterpane and ivy laid niel upon the sheets mrs forrester was concerned but not frightened mary will you bring the brandy from the sideboard george telephone dr dennison to come over at once now you other boys run out on the front porch and wait quietly there are too many of you in here she knelt by the bed putting brandy between niels white lips with a teaspoon the little boys withdrew only ivy peters remained standing in the back parlour just outside the bedroom door his arms folded across his chest taking in his surroundings with bold unblinking eyes mrs forrester glanced at him over her shoulder will you wait on the porch please you are older than the others and if anything is needed i can call on you ivy cursed himself but he had to go there was something final about her imperious courtesyhighandmighty he called it he had intended to sit down in the biggest leather chair and cross his legs and make himself at home but he found himself on the front porch put out by that delicately modulated voice as effectually as if he had been kicked out by the brawniest tough in town niel opened his eyes and looked wonderingly about the big half darkened room full of heavy oldfashioned walnut furniture he was lying on a white bed with ruffled pillow shams and mrs forrester was kneeling beside him bathing his forehead with cologne bohemian mary stood behind her with a basin of water ouch my arm he muttered and the perspiration broke out on his face yes dear im afraid its broken dont move dr dennison will be here in a few minutes it doesnt hurt very much does it nom he said faintly he was in pain but he felt weak and contented the room was cool and dusky and quiet at his house everything was horrid when one was sick what soft fingers mrs forrester had and what a lovely lady she was inside the lace ruffle of her dress he saw her white throat rising and falling so quickly suddenly she got up to take off her glittering rings she had not thought of them beforeshed them off her fingers with a quick motion as if she were washing her hands and dropped them into marys broad palm the little boy was thinking that he would probably never be in so nice a place again the windows went almost down to the baseboard like doors and the closed green shutters let in streaks of sunlight that quivered on the polished floor and the silver things on the dresser the heavy curtains were looped back with thick cords like ropes the marbletopped washstand was as big as a sideboard the massive walnut furniture was all inlaid with palecoloured woods niel had a scrollsaw and this inlay interested him there he looks better now doesnt he mary mrs forrester ran her fingers through his black hair and lightly kissed him on the forehead oh how sweet how sweet she smelled wheels on the bridge its doctor dennison go and show him in mary dr dennison set niels arm and took him home in his buggy home was not a pleasant place to go to a frail eggshell house set off on the edge of the prairie where people of no consequence lived except for the fact that he was judge pommeroys nephew niel would have been one of the boys to whom mrs forrester merely nodded brightly as she passed his father was a widower a poor relation a spinster from kentucky kept house for them and niel thought she was probably the worst housekeeper in the world their house was usually full of washing in various stages of incompletiontubs sitting about with linen soakingand the beds were aired until any hour in the afternoon when cousin sadie happened to think of making them up she liked to sit down after breakfast and read murder trials or peruse a wellworn copy of st elmo sadie was a goodnatured thing and was always running off to help a neighbour but niel hated to have anyone come to see them his father was at home very little spent all his time at his office he kept the county abstract books and made farm loans having lost his own property he invested other peoples money for them he was a gentle agreeable man young goodlooking with nice manners but niel felt there was an air of failure and defeat about his family he clung to his maternal uncle judge pommeroy whitewhiskered and portly who was captain forresters lawyer and a friend of all the great men who visited the forresters niel was proud like his mother she died when he was five years old she had hated the west and used haughtily to tell her neighbours that she would never think of living anywhere but in fayette county kentucky that they had only come to sweet water to make investments and to turn the crown into the pound by that phrase she was still remembered poor lady three for the next few years niel saw very little of mrs forrester she was an excitement that came and went with summer she and her husband always spent the winter in denver and colorado springs left sweet water soon after thanksgiving and did not return until the first of may he knew that mrs forrester liked him but she hadnt much time for growing boys when she had friends staying with her and gave a picnic supper for them or a dance in the grove on a moonlit night niel was always invited coming and going along the road to the marsh with the blum boys he sometimes met the captain driving visitors over in the democrat wagon and he heard about these people from black tom judge pommeroys faithful negro servant who went over to wait on the table for mrs forrester when she had a dinner party then came the accident which cut short the captains career as a roadbuilder after that fall with his horse he lay ill at the antlers in colorado springs all winter in the summer when mrs forrester brought him home to sweet water he still walked with a cane he had grown much heavier seemed encumbered by his own bulk and never suggested taking a contract for the railroad again he was able to work in his garden trimmed his snowball bushes and lilac hedges devoted a great deal of time to growing roses he and his wife still went away for the winter but each year the period of their absence grew shorter all this while the town of sweet water was changing its future no longer looked bright successive crop failures had broken the spirit of the farmers george adams and his family had gone back to massachusetts disillusioned about the west one by one the other gentlemen ranchers followed their example the forresters now had fewer visitors the burlington was drawing in its horns as people said and the railroad officials were not stopping off at sweet water so oftenwere more inclined to hurry past a town where they had sunk money that would never come back niel herberts father was one of the first failures to be crowded to the wall he closed his little house sent his cousin sadie back to kentucky and went to denver to accept an office position he left niel behind to read law in the office with his uncle not that niel had any taste for the law but he liked being with judge pommeroy and he might as well stay there as anywhere for the present the few thousand dollars his mother had left him would not be his until he was twentyone niel fitted up a room for himself behind the suite which the judge retained for his law offices on the second floor of the most pretentious brick block in town there he lived with monastic cleanliness and severity glad to be rid of his cousin and her inconsequential housewifery and resolved to remain a bachelor like his uncle he took care of the offices which meant that he did the janitor work and arranged them exactly to suit his taste making the rooms so attractive that all the judges friends and especially captain forrester dropped in there to talk oftener than ever the judge was proud of his nephew niel was now nineteen a tall straight deliberate boy his features were clearcut his grey eyes so dark that they looked black under his long lashes were rather moody and challenging the world did not seem overbright to young people just then his reserve which did not come from embarrassment or vanity but from a critical habit of mind made him seem older than he was and a little cold one winter afternoon only a few days before christmas niel sat writing in the back office at the long table where he usually worked or trifled surrounded by the judges fine law library and solemn steel engravings of statesmen and jurists his uncle was at his desk in the front office engaged in a friendly consultation with one of his country clients niel greatly bored with the notes he was copying was trying to invent an excuse for getting out on the street when he became aware of light footsteps coming rapidly down the outside corridor the door of the front office opened he heard his uncle rise quickly to his feet and at the same moment heard a womans laugha soft musical laugh which rose and descended like a suave scale he turned in his screw chair so that he could look over his shoulder through the double doors into the front room mrs forrester stood there shaking her muff at the judge and the bewildered swede farmer her quick eye lighted upon a bottle of bourbon and two glasses on the desk among the papers is that the way you prepare your cases judge what an example for niel she peeped through the door and nodded to the boy as he rose he remained in the back room however watching her while she declined the chair the judge pushed toward her and made a sign of refusal when he politely pointed to the bourbon she stood beside his desk in her long sealskin coat and cap a crimson scarf showing above the collar a little brown veil with spots tied over her eyes the veil did not in the least obscure those beautiful eyes dark and full of light set under a low white forehead and arching eyebrows the frosty air had brought no colour to her cheeksher skin had always the fragrant crystalline whiteness of white lilacs mrs forrester looked at one and one knew that she was bewitching it was instantaneous and it pierced the thickest hide the swede farmer was now grinning from ear to ear and he too had shuffled to his feet there could be no negative encounter however slight with mrs forrester if she merely bowed to you merely looked at you it constituted a personal relation something about her took hold of one in a flash one became acutely conscious of her of her fragility and grace of her mouth which could say so much without words of her eyes lively laughing intimate nearly always a little mocking will you and niel dine with us tomorrow evening judge and will you lend me tom weve just had a wire the ogdens are stopping over with us theyve been east to bring the girl home from schoolshes had mumps or something they want to get home for christmas but they will stop off for two days probably frank ellinger will come on from denver no prospect can afford me such pleasure as that of dining with mrs forrester said the judge ponderously thank you she bowed playfully and turned toward the double doors niel could you leave your work long enough to drive me home mr forrester has been detained at the bank niel put on his wolfskin coat mrs forrester took him by his shaggy sleeve and went with him quickly down the long corridor and the narrow stairs to the street at the hitchbar stood her cutter looking like a painted toy among the country sleds and wagons niel tucked the buffalo robes about mrs forrester untied the ponies and sprang in beside her without direction the team started down the frozen main street where few people were abroad crossed the creek on the ice and trotted up the poplarbordered lane toward the house on the hill the late afternoon sun burned on the snowcrusted pastures the poplars looked very tall and straight pinched up and severe in their winter poverty mrs forrester chatted to niel with her face turned toward him holding her muff up to break the wind im counting on you to help me entertain constance ogden can you take her off my hands day after tomorrow come over in the afternoon your duties as a lawyer arent very arduous yet she smiled teasingly what can i do with a miss of nineteen one who goes to college ive no learned conversation for her surely i havent niel exclaimed oh but youre a boy perhaps you can interest her in lighter things shes considered pretty do you think she is i havent seen her lately she was strikingchina blue eyes and heaps of yellow hair not exactly yellowwhat they call an ashen blond i believe niel had noticed that in describing the charms of other women mrs forrester always made fun of them a little they drew up in front of the house ben keezer came round from the kitchen to take the team you are to go back for mr forrester at six ben niel come in for a moment and get warm she drew him through the little storm entry which protected the front door in winter into the hall hang up your coat and come along he followed her through the parlour into the sittingroom where a little coal grate was burning under the black mantelpiece and sat down in the big leather chair in which captain forrester dozed after his midday meal it was a rather dark room with walnut bookcases that had carved tops and glass doors the floor was covered by a red carpet and the walls were hung with large oldfashioned engravings the house of the poet on the last day of pompeii shakespeare reading before queen elizabeth mrs forrester left him and presently returned carrying a tray with a decanter and sherry glasses she put it down on her husbands smokingtable poured out a glass for niel and one for herself and perched on the arm of one of the stuffed chairs where she sat sipping her sherry and stretching her tiny silverbuckled slippers out toward the glowing coals its so nice to have you staying on until after christmas niel observed youve only been here one other christmas since i can remember im afraid were staying on all winter this year mr forrester thinks we cant afford to go away for some reason we are extraordinarily poor just now like everybody else the boy commented grimly yes like everybody else however it does no good to be glum about it does it she refilled the two glasses i always take a little sherry at this time in the afternoon at colorado springs some of my friends take tea like the english but i should feel like an old woman drinking tea besides sherry is good for my throat niel remembered some legend about a weak chest and occasional terrifying hemorrhages but that seemed doubtful as one looked at herfragile indeed but with such light effervescing vitality perhaps i do seem old to you niel quite old enough for tea and a cap he smiled gravely you seem always the same to me mrs forrester yes and how is that lovely just lovely as she bent forward to put down her glass she patted his cheek oh youll do very well for constance then seriously im glad if i do though i want you to like me well enough to come to see us often this winter you shall come with your uncle to make a fourth at whist mr forrester must have his whist in the evening do you think he is looking any worse niel it frightens me to see him getting a little uncertain but there we must believe in good luck she took up the halfempty glass and held it against the light niel liked to see the firelight sparkle on her earrings long pendants of garnets and seedpearls in the shape of fleursdelys she was the only woman he knew who wore earrings they hung naturally against her thin triangular cheeks captain forrester although he had given her handsomer ones liked to see her wear these because they had been his mothers it gratified him to have his wife wear jewels it meant something to him she never left off her beautiful rings unless she was in the kitchen a winter in the country may do him good said mrs forrester after a silence during which she looked intently into the fire as if she were trying to read the outcome of their difficulties there he loves this place so much but you and judge pommeroy must keep an eye on him when he is in town niel if he looks tired or uncertain make some excuse and bring him home he cant carry a drink or two as he usedshe glanced over her shoulder to see that the door into the diningroom was shut once last winter he had been drinking with some old friends at the antlersnothing unusual just as he always did as a man must be able to dobut it was too much for him when he came out to join me in the carriage coming down that long walk you know he fell there was no ice he didnt slip it was simply because he was unsteady he had trouble getting up i still shiver to think of it to me it was as if one of the mountains had fallen down a little later niel went plunging down the hill looking exultantly into the streak of red sunset oh the winter would not be so bad this year how strange that she should be here at all a woman like her among common people not even in denver had he ever seen another woman so elegant he had sat in the diningroom of the brown palace hotel and watched them as they came down to dinner fashionable women from the east on their way to california but he had never found one so attractive and distinguished as mrs forrester compared with her other women were heavy and dull even the pretty ones seemed lifelessthey had not that something in their glance that made ones blood tingle and never elsewhere had he heard anything like her inviting musical laugh that was like the distant measures of dance music heard through opening and shutting doors he could remember the very first time he ever saw mrs forrester when he was a little boy he had been loitering in front of the episcopal church one sunday morning when a low carriage drove up to the door ben keezer was on the front seat and on the back seat was a lady alone in a black silk dress all puffs and ruffles and a black hat carrying a parasol with a carved ivory handle as the carriage stopped she lifted her dress to alight out of a swirl of foamy white petticoats she thrust a black shiny slipper she stepped lightly to the ground and with a nod to the driver went into the church the little boy followed her through the open door saw her enter a pew and kneel he was proud now that at the first moment he had recognized her as belonging to a different world from any he had ever known niel paused for a moment at the end of the lane to look up at the last skeleton poplar in the long row just above its pointed tip hung the hollow silver winter moon four in pleasant weather judge pommeroy walked to the forresters but on the occasion of the dinner for the ogdens he engaged the liveryman to take him and his nephew over in one of the town hacksvehicles seldom used except for funerals and weddings they smelled strongly of the stable and contained laprobes as heavy as lead and as slippery as oiled paper niel and his uncle were the only townspeople asked to the forresters that evening they rolled over the creek and up the hill in state and emerged covered with horsehair captain forrester met them at the door his burly figure buttoned up in a frock coat a flat collar and black string tie under the heavy folds of his neck he was always cleanshaven except for a drooping duncoloured moustache the company stood behind him laughing while niel caught up the whiskbroom and began dusting roan hairs off his uncles broadcloth mrs forrester gave niel a brushing in turn and then took him into the parlour and introduced him to mrs ogden and her daughter the daughter was a rather pretty girl niel thought in a pale pink evening dress which left bare her smooth arms and short dimpled neck her eyes were as mrs forrester had said a china blue rather prominent and inexpressive her fleece of ashygold hair was bound about her head with silver bands in spite of her fresh roselike complexion her face was not altogether agreeable two dissatisfied lines reached from the corners of her short nose to the corners of her mouth when she was displeased even a little these lines tightened drew her nose back and gave her a suspicious injured expression niel sat down by her and did his best but he found her hard to talk to she seemed nervous and distracted kept glancing over her shoulder and crushing her handkerchief up in her hands her mind clearly was elsewhere after a few moments he turned to the mother who was more easily interested mrs ogden was almost unpardonably homely she had a pearshaped face and across her high forehead lay a row of flat dry curls her bluish brown skin was almost the colour of her violet dinner dress a diamond necklace glittered about her wrinkled throat unlike constance she seemed thoroughly amiable but as she talked she tilted her head and used her eyes availing herself of those arch glances which he had supposed only pretty women indulged in probably she had long been surrounded by people to whom she was an important personage and had acquired the manner of a spoiled darling niel thought her rather foolish at first but in a few moments he had got used to her mannerisms and began to like her he found himself laughing heartily and forgot the discouragement of his failure with the daughter mr ogden a short weatherbeaten man of fifty with a cast in one eye a stiff imperial and twisted moustaches was noticeably quieter and less expansive than when niel had met him here on former occasions he seemed to expect his wife to do the talking when mrs forrester addressed him or passed near him his good eye twinkled and followed herwhile the eye that looked askance remained unchanged and committed itself to nothing suddenly everyone became more lively the air warmed and the lamplight seemed to brighten as a fourth member of the denver party came in from the diningroom with a glittering tray full of cocktails he had been making frank ellinger was a bachelor of forty six feet two with long straight legs fine shoulders and a figure that still permitted his white waistcoat to button without a wrinkle under his conspicuously wellcut dinner coat his black hair coarse and curly as the filling of a mattress was grey about the ears his florid face showed little purple veins about his beaked nosea nose like the prow of a ship with long nostrils his chin was deeply cleft his thick curly lips seemed very muscular very much under his control and with his strong white teeth irregular and curved gave him the look of a man who could bite an iron rod in two with a snap of his jaws his whole figure seemed very much alive under his clothes with a restless muscular energy that had something of the cruelty of wild animals in it niel was very much interested in this man the hero of many ambiguous stories he didnt know whether he liked him or not he knew nothing bad about him but he felt something evil the cocktails were the signal for general conversation the company drew together in one group even miss constance seemed less dissatisfied ellinger drank his cocktail standing beside her chair and offered her the cherry in his glass they were old fashioned whiskey cocktails nobody drank martinis then gin was supposed to be the consolation of sailors and inebriate scrub women very good frank very good captain forrester pronounced drawing out a fresh colognescented handkerchief to wipe his moustache are encores in order the captain puffed slightly when he talked his eyes always somewhat suffused and bloodshot since his injury blinked at his friends from under his heavy lids one more round for everybody captain ellinger brought in from the sideboard a capacious shaker and refilled all the glasses except miss ogdens at her he shook his finger and offered her the little dish of maraschino cherries no i dont want those i want the one in your glass she said with a pouty smile i like it to taste of something constance said her mother reprovingly rolling her eyes at mrs forrester as if to share with her the charm of such innocence niel mrs forrester laughed wont you give the child your cherry too niel promptly crossed the room and proffered the cherry in the bottom of his glass she took it with her thumb and forefinger and dropped it into her ownwhere he was quick to observe she left it when they went out to dinner a stubborn piece of pink flesh he decided and certainly a fool about a man quite old enough to be her father he sighed when he saw that he was placed next her at the dinner table captain forrester still made a commanding figure at the head of his own table with his napkin tucked under his chin and the work of carving well in hand nobody could lay bare the bones of a brace of duck or a twentypound turkey more deftly what part of the turkey do you prefer mrs ogden if one had a preference it was gratified with all the stuffing and gravy that went with it and the vegetables properly placed when a plate left captain forresters hands it was a dinner the recipient was served and well served he served mrs forrester last of the ladies but before the men and to her too he said mrs forrester what part of the turkey shall i give you this evening he was a man who did not vary his formulae or his manners he was no more mobile than his countenance niel and judge pommeroy had often remarked how much captain forrester looked like the pictures of grover cleveland his clumsy dignity covered a deep nature and a conscience that had never been juggled with his repose was like that of a mountain when he laid his fleshy thickfingered hand upon a frantic horse an hysterical woman an irish workman out for blood he brought them peace something they could not resist that had been the secret of his management of men his sanity asked nothing claimed nothing it was so simple that it brought a hush over distracted creatures in the old days when he was building road in the black hills trouble sometimes broke out in camp when he was absent staying with mrs forrester at colorado springs he would put down the telegram that announced an insurrection and say to his wife maidy i must go to the men and that was all he didhe went to them while the captain was intent upon his duties as host he talked very little and judge pommeroy and ellinger kept a lively crossfire of amusing stories going niel sitting opposite ellinger watched him closely he still couldnt decide whether he liked him or not in denver frank was known as a prince of good fellows tactful generous resourceful though apt to trim his sails to the wind a man who goodhumouredly bowed to the inevitable or to the almost inevitable he had when he was younger been notoriously wild but that was not held against him even by mothers with marriageable daughters like mrs ogden morals were different in those days niel had heard his uncle refer to ellingers youthful infatuation with a woman called nell emerald a handsome and rather unusual woman who conducted a house properly licensed by the denver police nell emerald had told an old club man that though she had been out behind young ellingers new trotting horse she had no respect for a man who would go driving with a prostitute in broad daylight this story and a dozen like it were often related of ellinger and the women laughed over them as heartily as the men all the while that he was making a scandalous chronicle for himself young ellinger had been devotedly caring for an invalid mother and he was described to strangers as a terribly fast young man and a model son that combination pleased the taste of the time nobody thought the worse of him now that his mother was dead he lived at the brown palace hotel though he still kept her house at colorado springs when the roast was well under way black tom very formal in a white waistcoat and high collar poured the champagne captain forrester lifted his glass the frail stem between his thick fingers and glancing round the table at his guests and at mrs forrester said happy days it was the toast he always drank at dinner the invocation he was sure to utter when he took a glass of whiskey with an old friend whoever had heard him say it once liked to hear him say it again nobody else could utter those two words as he did with such gravity and high courtesy it seemed a solemn moment seemed to knock at the door of fate behind which all days happy and otherwise were hidden niel drank his wine with a pleasant shiver thinking that nothing else made life seem so precarious the future so cryptic and unfathomable as that brief toast uttered by the massive man happy days mrs ogden turned to the host with her most languishing smile captain forrester i want you to tell constanceshe was an east virginia woman and what she really said was capn forrester ah wan yew to tell etc her vowels seemed to roll about in the same way her eyes didi want you to tell constance about how you first found this lovely spot way back in indian times the captain looked down the table between the candles at mrs forrester as if to consult her she smiled and nodded and her beautiful earrings swung beside her pale cheeks she was wearing her diamonds tonight and a black velvet gown her husband had archaic ideas about jewels a man bought them for his wife in acknowledgment of things he could not gracefully utter they must be costly they must show that he was able to buy them and that she was worthy to wear them with her approval the captain began his narrative a concise account of how he came west a young boy after serving in the civil war and took a job as driver for a freighting company that carried supplies across the plains from nebraska city to cherry creek as denver was then called the freighters after embarking in that sea of grass six hundred miles in width lost all count of the days of the week and the month one day was like another and all were glorious good hunting plenty of antelope and buffalo boundless sunny sky boundless plains of waving grass long freshwater lagoons yellow with lagoon flowers where the bison in their periodic migrations stopped to drink and bathe and wallow an ideal life for a young man the captain pronounced once when he was driven out of the trail by a washout he rode south on his horse to explore and found an indian encampment near the sweet water on this very hill where his house now stood he was he said greatly taken with the location and made up his mind that he would one day have a house there he cut down a young willow tree and drove the stake into the ground to mark the spot where he wished to build he went away and did not come back for many years he was helping to lay the first railroad across the plains there were those that were dependent on me he said i had sickness to contend with and responsibilities but in all those years i expect there was hardly a day passed that i did not remember the sweet water and this hill when i came here a young man i had planned it in my mind pretty much as it is today where i would dig my well and where i would plant my grove and my orchard i planned to build a house that my friends could come to with a wife like mrs forrester to make it attractive to them i used to promise myself that some day i would manage it this part of the story the captain told not with embarrassment but with reserve choosing his words slowly absently cracking english walnuts with his strong fingers and heaping a little hoard of kernels beside his plate his friends understood that he was referring to his first marriage to the poor invalid wife who had never been happy and who had kept his nose to the grindstone when things looked most discouraging he went on i came back here once and bought the place from the railroad company they took my note i found my willow stakeit had rooted and grown into a treeand i planted three more to mark the corners of my house twelve years later mrs forrester came here with me shortly after our marriage and we built our house captain forrester puffed from time to time but his clear account commanded attention something in the way he uttered his unornamented phrases gave them the impressiveness of inscriptions cut in stone mrs forrester nodded at him from her end of the table and now tell us your philosophy of lifethis is where it comes in she laughed teasingly the captain coughed and looked abashed i was intending to omit that tonight some of our guests have already heard it no no it belongs at the end of the story and if some of us have heard it we can hear it again go on well then my philosophy is that what you think of and plan for day by day in spite of yourself so to speakyou will get you will get it more or less that is unless you are one of the people who get nothing in this world there are such people i have lived too much in mining works and construction camps not to know that he paused as if though this was too dark a chapter to be gone into it must have its place its moment of silent recognition if you are not one of those constance and niel you will accomplish what you dream of most and why thats the interesting part of it his wife prompted him because he roused himself from his abstraction and looked about at the company because a thing that is dreamed of in the way i mean is already an accomplished fact all our great west has been developed from such dreams the homesteaders and the prospectors and the contractors we dreamed the railroads across the mountains just as i dreamed my place on the sweet water all these things will be everyday facts to the coming generation but to us captain forrester ended with a sort of grunt something forbidding had come into his voice the lonely defiant note that is so often heard in the voices of old indians mrs ogden had listened to the story with such sympathy that niel liked her better than ever and even the preoccupied constance seemed able to give it her attention they rose from the dessert and went into the parlour to arrange the card tables the captain still played whist as well as ever as he brought out a box of his best cigars he paused before mrs ogden and said is smoke offensive to you mrs ogden when she protested that it was not he crossed the room to where constance was talking with ellinger and asked with the same grave courtesy is smoke offensive to you constance had there been half a dozen women present he would have asked that question of each probably and in the same words it did not bother him to repeat a phrase if an expression answered his purpose he saw no reason for varying it mrs forrester and mr ogden were to play against mrs ogden and the captain constance said mrs forrester as she sat down will you play with niel im told hes very good miss ogdens short nose flickered up the lines on either side of it deepened and she again looked injured niel was sure she detested him he was not going to be done in by her miss ogden he said as he stood beside his chair deliberately shuffling a pack of cards my uncle and i are used to playing together and probably you are used to playing with mr ellinger suppose we try that combination she gave him a quick suspicious glance from under her yellow eyelashes and flung herself into a chair without so much as answering him frank ellinger came in from the diningroom where he had been sampling the captains french brandy and took the vacant seat opposite miss ogden so its you and me connie good enough he exclaimed cutting the pack niel pushed toward him just before midnight black tom opened the door and announced that the eggnog was ready the card players went into the diningroom where the punchbowl stood smoking on the table constance said captain forrester do you sing i like to hear one of the old songs with the eggnog ahm sorry capn forrester ah really havent any voice niel noticed that whenever constance spoke to the captain she strained her throat though he wasnt in the least deaf he broke in over her refusal uncle can start a song if you coax him sir judge pommeroy after smoothing his silver whiskers and coughing began auld lang syne the others joined in but they hadnt got to the end of it when a hollow rumbling down on the bridge made them laugh and everyone ran to the front windows to see the judges funeral coach come lurching up the hill with only one of the side lanterns lit mrs forrester sent tom out with a drink for the driver while niel and his uncle were putting on their overcoats in the hall she came up to them and whispered coaxingly to the boy remember you are coming over tomorrow at two i am planning a drive and i want you to amuse constance for me niel bit his lip and looked down into mrs forresters laughing persuasive eyes ill do it for you but thats the only reason he said threateningly i understand for me ill credit it to your account the judge and his nephew rolled away on swaying springs the ogdens retired to their rooms upstairs mrs forrester went to help the captain divest himself of his frock coat and put it away for him ever since he was hurt he had to be propped high on pillows at night and he slept in a narrow iron bed in the alcove which had formerly been his wifes dressingroom while he was undressing he breathed heavily and sighed as if he were very tired he fumbled with his studs then blew on his fingers and tried again his wife came to his aid and quickly unbuttoned everything he did not thank her in words but submitted gratefully when the iron bed creaked at receiving his heavy figure she called from the big bedroom goodnight mr forrester and drew the heavy curtains that shut off the alcove she took off her rings and earrings and was beginning to unfasten her black velvet bodice when at a tinkle of glass from without she stopped short re hooking the shoulder of her gown she went to the diningroom now faintly lit by the coal fire in the back parlour frank ellinger was standing at the sideboard taking a nightcap the forrester french brandy was old and heavy like a cordial be careful she murmured as she approached him i have a distinct impression that there is someone on the enclosed stairway there is a wide crack in the door ah but kittens have claws these days pour me just a little thank you ill have mine in by the fire he followed her into the next room where she stood by the grate looking at him in the light of the pale blue flames that ran over the fresh coal put on to keep the fire youve had a good many brandies frank she said studying his flushed masterful face not too many ill need them tonight he replied meaningly she nervously brushed back a lock of hair that had come down a little its not tonight its morning go to bed and sleep as late as you please take care i heard silk stockings on the stairs goodnight she put her hand on the sleeve of his coat the white fingers clung to the black cloth as bits of paper cling to magnetized iron her touch soft as it was went through the man all the feet and inches of him his broad shoulders lifted on a deep breath he looked down at her her eyes fell goodnight she said faintly as she turned quickly away the train of her velvet dress caught the leg of his broadcloth trousers and dragged with a friction that crackled and threw sparks both started they stood looking at each other for a moment before she actually slipped through the door ellinger remained by the hearth his arms folded tight over his chest his curly lips compressed frowning into the fire five niel went up the hill the next afternoon just as the cutter with the two black ponies jingled round the driveway and stopped at the front door mrs forrester came out on the porch dressed for a sleigh ride ellinger followed her buttoned up in a long fur lined coat showily befrogged down the front with a glossy astrachan collar he looked even more powerful and bursting with vigour than last night his highlycoloured wellvisored countenance shone with a good opinion of himself and of the world mrs forrester called to niel gaily we are going down to the sweet water to cut cedar boughs for christmas will you keep constance company she seems a trifle disappointed at being left behind but we cant take the big sleighthe pole is broken be nice to her theres a good boy she pressed his hand gave him a meaning confidential smile and stepped into the sleigh ellinger sprang in beside her and they glided down the hill with a merry tinkle of sleighbells niel found miss ogden in the back parlour playing solitaire by the fire she was clearly out of humour come in mr herbert i think they might have taken us along dont you i want to see the river my own self i hate bein shut up in the house lets go out then wouldnt you like to see the town constance seemed not to hear him she was wrinkling and unwrinkling her short nose and the restless lines about her mouth were fluttering whats to hinder us from getting a sleigh at the livery barn and going down to the sweet water i dont suppose the rivers private property she gave a nervous angry laugh and looked hopefully at niel we couldnt get anything at this hour the livery teams are all out he said with firmness constance glanced at him suspiciously then sat down at the card table and leaned over it drawing her plump shoulders together her fluffy yellow hair was wound round her head like a scarf and held in place by narrow bands of black velvet the ponies had crossed the second creek and were trotting down the high road toward the river mrs forrester expressed her feelings in a laugh full of mischief is she running after us where did she get the idea that she was to come what a relief to get away she lifted her chin and sniffed the air the day was grey without sun and the air was still and dry a warm cold poor mr ogden she went on how much livelier he is without his ladies they almost extinguish him now arent you glad you never married im certainly glad i never married a homely woman what does a man do it for anyway she had no moneyand hes always had it or been on the way to it well theyre off tomorrow and connie youve reduced her to a state of imbecility really what an afternoon niel must be having she laughed as if the idea of his predicament delighted her whos this kid anyway ellinger asked her to take the reins for a moment while he drew a cigar from his pocket hes a trifle stiff does he make himself useful oh hes a nice boy stranded here like the rest of us im going to train him to be very useful hes devoted to mr forrester handsome dont you think soso they turned into a byroad that wound along the sweet water ellinger held the ponies in a little and turned down his high astrachan collar lets have a look at you marian mrs forrester was holding her muff before her face to catch the flying particles of snow the ponies kicked up from behind it she glanced at him sidewise well she said teasingly he put his arm through hers and settled himself low in the sleigh you ought to look at me better than that its been a devil of a long while since ive seen you perhaps its been too long she murmured the mocking spark in her eyes softened perceptibly under the long pressure of his arm yes its been long she admitted lightly you didnt answer the letter i wrote you on the eleventh didnt i well at any rate i answered your telegram she drew her head away as his face came nearer youll really have to watch the ponies my dear or theyll tumble us out in the snow i dont care i wish they would he said between his teeth why didnt you answer my letter oh i dont remember you dont write so many its no satisfaction you wont let me write you love letters you say its risky so it is and foolish but now you neednt be so careful not too careful she laughed softly when im off in the country for a whole winter alone and growing older i like to she put her hand on his to be reminded of pleasanter things ellinger took off his glove with his teeth his eyes sweeping the winding road and the low snowcovered bluffs had something wolfish in them be careful frank my rings you hurt me then why didnt you take them off you used to are these your cedars shall we stop here no not here she spoke very low the best ones are farther on in a deep ravine that winds back into the hills ellinger glanced at her averted head and his heavy lips twitched in a smile at one corner the quality of her voice had changed and he knew the change they went spinning along the curves of the winding road saying not a word mrs forrester sat with her head bent forward her face half hidden in her muff at last she told him to stop to the right of the road he saw a thicket behind it a dry watercourse wound into the bluffs the tops of the dark still cedars just visible from the road indicated its windings sit still he said while i take out the horses when the blue shadows of approaching dusk were beginning to fall over the snow one of the blum boys slipping quietly along through the timber in search of rabbits came upon the empty cutter standing in the brush and near it the two ponies stamping impatiently where they were tied adolph slid back into the thicket and lay down behind a fallen log to see what would happen not much ever happened to him but weather presently he heard low voices coming nearer from the ravine the big stranger who was visiting at the forresters emerged carrying the buffalo robes on one arm mrs forrester herself was clinging to the other they walked slowly wholly absorbed by what they were saying to each other when they came up to the sleigh the man spread the robes on the seat and put his hands under mrs forresters arms to lift her in but he did not lift her he stood for a long while holding her crushed up against his breast her face hidden in his black overcoat what about those damned cedar boughs he asked after he had put her in and covered her up shall i go back and cut some it doesnt matter she murmured he reached under the seat for a hatchet and went back to the ravine mrs forrester sat with her eyes closed her cheek pillowed on her muff a faint soft smile on her lips the air was still and blue the blum boy could almost hear her breathe when the strokes of the hatchet rang out from the ravine he could see her eyelids flutter soft shivers went through her body the man came back and threw the evergreens into the sleigh when he got in beside her she slipped her hand through his arm and settled softly against him drive slowly she murmured as if she were talking in her sleep it doesnt matter if we are late for dinner nothing matters the ponies trotted off the pale blum boy rose from behind his log and followed the tracks up the ravine when the orange moon rose over the bluffs he was still sitting under the cedars his gun on his knee while mrs forrester had been waiting there in the sleigh with her eyes closed feeling so safe he could almost have touched her with his hand he had never seen her before when her mocking eyes and lively manner were not between her and all the world if it had been thad grimes who lay behind that log now or ivy peters but with adolph blum her secrets were safe his mind was feudal the rich and fortunate were also the privileged these warm blooded quickbreathing people took chancesfollowed impulses only dimly understandable to a boy who was wet and weatherchapped all the year who waded in the mud fishing for cat or lay in the marsh waiting for wild duck mrs forrester had never been too haughty to smile at him when he came to the back door with his fish she never haggled about the price she treated him like a human being his little chats with her her nod and smile when she passed him on the street were among the pleasantest things he had to remember she bought game of him in the closed season and didnt give him away six it was during that winter the first one mrs forrester had ever spent in the house on the hill that niel came to know her very well for the forresters that winter was a sort of isthmus between two estates soon afterward came a change in their fortunes and for niel it was a natural turningpoint since in the autumn he was nineteen and in the spring he was twentya very great difference after the christmas festivities were over the whist parties settled into a regular routine three evenings a week judge pommeroy and his nephew sat down to cards with the forresters sometimes they went over early and dined there sometimes they stayed for a late supper after the last rubber niel who had been so content with a bachelors life and who had made up his mind that he would never live in a place that was under the control of women found himself becoming attached to the comforts of a well conducted house to the pleasures of the table to the soft chairs and soft lights and agreeable human voices at the forresters on bitter windy nights sitting in his favourite blue chair before the grate he used to wonder how he could manage to tear himself away to plunge into the outer darkness and run down the long frozen road and up the dead street of the town captain forrester was experimenting with bulbs that winter and had built a little glass conservatory on the south side of the house off the back parlour through january and february the house was full of narcissus and roman hyacinths and their heavy springlike odour made a part of the enticing comfort of the fireside there where mrs forrester was dulness was impossible niel believed the charm of her conversation was not so much in what she said though she was often witty but in the quick recognition of her eyes in the living quality of her voice itself one could talk with her about the most trivial things and go away with a high sense of elation the secret of it he supposed was that she couldnt help being interested in people even very commonplace people if mr ogden or mr dalzell were not there to tell their best stories for her then she could be amused by ivy peters ruffianly manners or the soft compliments of old man elliott when he sold her a pair of winter shoes she had a fascinating gift of mimicry when she mentioned the fat iceman or thad grimes at his meat block or the blum boys with their dead rabbits by a subtle suggestion of their manner she made them seem more individual and vivid than they were in their own person she often caricatured people to their faces and they were not offended but greatly flattered nothing pleased one more than to provoke her laughter then you felt you were getting on with her it was her form of commenting of agreeing with you and appreciating you when you said something interestingand it often told you a great deal that was both too direct and too elusive for words long long afterward when niel did not know whether mrs forrester were living or dead if her image flashed into his mind it came with a brightness of dark eyes her pale triangular cheeks with long earrings and her manycoloured laugh when he was dull dull and tired of everything he used to think that if he could hear that longlost lady laugh again he could be gay the big storm of the winter came late that year swept down over sweet water the first day of march and beat upon the town for three days and nights thirty inches of snow fell and the cutting wind blew it into whirling drifts the forresters were snowed in ben keezer their man of all work did not attempt to break a road or even to come over to the town himself on the third day niel went to the postoffice got the captains leather mail sack with its accumulation of letters and set off across the creek plunging into drifts up to his middle sometimes up to his armpits the fences along the lane were covered but he broke his trail by keeping between the two lines of poplars when at last he reached the front porch captain forrester came to the door and let him in glad to see you my boy very glad its been a little lonesome for us you must have had hard work getting over i certainly appreciate it come to the sittingroom fire and dry yourself we will talk quietly mrs forrester has gone upstairs to lie down shes been complaining of a headache niel stood before the fire in his rubber boots drying his trousers the captain did not sit down but opened the glass door into his little conservatory ive something pretty to show you niel all my hyacinths are coming along at once every colour of the rainbow the roman hyacinths i say are mrs forresters they seem to suit her niel went to the door and looked with keen pleasure at the fresh watery blossoms i was afraid you might lose them in this bitter weather captain no these things can stand a good deal of cold theyve been company for us he stood looking out through the glass at the drifted shrubbery niel liked to see him look out over his place a mans house is his castle his look seemed to say ben tells me the rabbits have come up to the barn to eat the hay everything green is covered up i had him throw a few cabbages out for them so they wont suffer mrs forrester has been on the porch every day feeding the snow birds he went on as if talking to himself the stair door opened and mrs forrester came down in her japanese dressinggown looking very pale the dark shadows under her eyes seemed to mean that she had been losing sleep oh its niel how nice of you and youve brought the mail are there any letters for me three two from denver and one from california her husband gave them to her did you sleep maidy no but i rested its delightful up in the west room the wind sings and whistles about the eaves if youll excuse me ill dress and glance at my letters stand closer to the fire niel are you very wet when she stopped beside him to feel his clothes he smelled a sharp odour of spirits was she ill he wondered or merely so bored that she had been trying to dull herself when she came back she had dressed and rearranged her hair mrs forrester said the captain in a solicitous tone i believe i would like some tea and toast this afternoon like your english friends and it would be good for your head we wont offer niel anything else very well mary has gone to bed with a toothache but i will make the tea niel can make the toast here by the fire while you read your paper she was cheerful nowtied one of marys aprons about niels neck and set him down with the toasting fork he noticed that the captain as he read his paper kept his eye on the sideboard with a certain watchfulness and when his wife brought the tray with tea and no sherry he seemed very much pleased he drank three cups and took a second piece of toast you see mr forrester she said lightly niel has brought back my appetite i ate no lunch today turning to the boy ive been shut up too long is there anything in the papers this meant was there any news concerning the people they knew the captain put on his silverrimmed glasses again and read aloud about the doings of their friends in denver and omaha and kansas city mrs forrester sat on a stool by the fire eating toast and making humorous comments upon the subjects of those solemn paragraphs the engagement of miss erma saltonsmith etc at last thank god you remember her niel shes been here i think you danced with her i dont think i do what is she like shes exactly like her name dont you remember tall very animated glittering eyes like the ancient mariners niel laughed dont you like bright eyes mrs forrester not any others i dont she joined in his laugh so gaily that the captain looked out over his paper with an expression of satisfaction he let the journal slowly crumple on his knees and sat watching the two beside the grate to him they seemed about the same age it was a habit with him to think of mrs forrester as very very young she noticed that he was not reading would you like me to light the lamp mr forrester no thank you the twilight is very pleasant it was twilight by now they heard mary come downstairs and begin stirring about the kitchen the captain his slippers in the zone of firelight and his heavy shoulders in shadow snored from time to time as the room grew dusky the windows were squares of clear pale violet and the shutters ceased to rattle the wind was dying with the day everything was still except when bohemian mary roughly clattered a pan mrs forrester whispered that she was out of sorts because her sweetheart joe pucelik hadnt been over to see her sunday night was his regular night and sunday was the first day of the blizzard when shes neglected her tooth always begins to ache well now that ive got over hell have to come or she will be in a temper oh hell come mrs forrester shrugged i am blind and deaf but im quite sure she makes it worth his while after a few moments she rose come she whispered mr forrester is asleep lets run down the hill theres no one to stop us ill slip on my rubber boots no objections she put her fingers on his lips not a word i cant stand this house a moment longer they slipped quietly out of the front door into the cold air which tasted of newfallen snow a clear arc of blue and rose colour painted the west over the buried town when they reached the rounded breast of the hill blown almost bare mrs forrester stood still and drew in deep breaths looking down over the drifted meadows and the stiff blue poplars oh but it is bleak she murmured suppose we should have to stay here all next winter too and the next what will become of me niel there was fear unmistakable fright in her voice you see there is nothing for me to do i get no exercise i dont skate we didnt in california and my ankles are weak ive always danced in the winter theres plenty of dancing at colorado springs you wouldnt believe how i miss it i shall dance till im eighty ill be the waltzing grandmother its good for me i need it they plunged down into the drifts and did not stop again until they reached the wooden bridge see even the creek is frozen i thought running water never froze how long will it be like this not long now in a month youll see the green begin in the marsh and run over the meadows its lovely over here in the spring and youll be able to get out tomorrow mrs forrester the clouds are thinning look theres the new moon she turned oh i saw it over the wrong shoulder no you didnt you saw it over mine she sighed and took his arm my dear boy your shoulders arent broad enough instantly before his eyes rose the image of a pair of shoulders that were very broad objectionably broad clad in a frogged overcoat with an astrachan collar the intrusion of this third person annoyed him as they went slowly back up the hill curiously enough it was as captain forresters wife that she most interested niel and it was in her relation to her husband that he most admired her given her other charming attributes her comprehension of a man like the railroadbuilder her loyalty to him stamped her more than anything else that he felt was quality something that could never become worn or shabby steel of damascus his admiration of mrs forrester went back to that just as he felt she herself went back to it he rather liked the stories even the spiteful ones about the gay life she led in colorado and the young men she kept dangling about her every winter he sometimes thought of the life she might have been living ever since he had known herand the one she had chosen to live from that disparity he believed came the subtlest thrill of her fascination she mocked outrageously at the proprieties she observed and inherited the magic of contradictions seven on the evenings when there was no whist at the forresters niel usually sat in his room and readbut not law as he was supposed to do the winter before when the forresters were away and one dull day dragged after another he had come upon a copious diversion an almost inexhaustible resource the high narrow bookcase in the back office between the double doors and the wall was filled from top to bottom with rows of solemn looking volumes bound in dark cloth which were kept apart from the law library an almost complete set of the bohn classics which judge pommeroy had bought long ago when he was a student at the university of virginia he had brought them west with him not because he read them a great deal but because in his day a gentleman had such books in his library just as he had claret in his cellar among them was a set of byron in three volumes and last winter apropos of a quotation which niel didnt recognize his uncle advised him to read byronall except don juan that the judge remarked with a deep smile he could save until later niel of course began with don juan then he read tom jones and wilhelm meister and raced on until he came to montaigne and a complete translation of ovid he hadnt finished yet with these last always went back to them after other experiments these authors seemed to him to know their business even in don juan there was a little fooling but with these gentlemen none there were philosophical works in the collection but he did no more than open and glance at them he had no curiosity about what men had thought but about what they had felt and lived he had a great deal if anyone had told him that these were classics and represented the wisdom of the ages he would doubtless have let them alone but ever since he had first found them for himself he had been living a double life with all its guilty enjoyments he read the heroides over and over and felt that they were the most glowing love stories ever told he did not think of these books as something invented to beguile the idle hour but as living creatures caught in the very behaviour of livingsurprised behind their misleading severity of form and phrase he was eavesdropping upon the past being let into the great world that had plunged and glittered and sumptuously sinned long before little western towns were dreamed of those rapt evenings beside the lamp gave him a long perspective influenced his conception of the people about him made him know just what he wished his own relations with these people to be for some reason his reading made him wish to become an architect if the judge had left his bohn library behind him in kentucky his nephews life might have turned out differently spring came at last and the forrester place had never been so lovely the captain spent long happy days among his flowering shrubs and his wife used to say to visitors yes you can see mr forrester in a moment i will send the english gardener to call him early in june when the captains roses were just coming on his pleasant labors were interrupted one morning an alarming telegram reached him he cut it open with his garden shears came into the house and asked his wife to telephone for judge pommeroy a savings bank one in which he was largely interested had failed in denver that evening the captain and his lawyer went west on the express the judge when he was giving niel final instructions about the office business told him he was afraid the captain was bound to lose a good deal of money mrs forrester seemed unaware of any danger she went to the station to see her husband off spoke of his errand merely as a business trip niel however felt a foreboding gloom he dreaded poverty for her she was one of the people who ought always to have money any retrenchment of their generous way of living would be a hardship for herwould be unfitting she would not be herself in straitened circumstances niel took his meals at the town hotel on the third day after captain forresters departure he was annoyed to find frank ellingers name on the hotel register ellinger did not appear at supper which meant of course that he was dining with mrs forrester and that the lady herself would get his dinner she had taken the occasion of the captains absence to let bohemian mary go to visit her mother on the farm for a week niel thought it very bad taste in ellinger to come to sweet water when captain forrester was away he must know that it would stir up the gossips niel had meant to call on mrs forrester that evening but now he went back to the office instead he read late and after he went to bed he slept lightly he was awakened before dawn by the puffing of the switch engine down at the round house he tried to muffle his ears in the sheet and go to sleep again but the sound of escaping steam for some reason excited him he could not shut out the feeling that it was summer and that the dawn would soon be flaming gloriously over the forresters marsh he had awakened with that intense blissful realization of summer which sometimes comes to children in their beds he rose and dressed quickly he would get over to the hill before frank ellinger could intrude his unwelcome presence while he was still asleep in the best bedroom of the wimbleton hotel an impulse of affection and guardianship drew niel up the poplar bordered road in the early lightthough he did not go near the house itself but at the second bridge cut round through the meadow and on to the marsh the sky was burning with the soft pink and silver of a cloudless summer dawn the heavy bowed grasses splashed him to the knees all over the marsh snowonthe mountain globed with dew made cool sheets of silver and the swamp milkweed spread its flat raspberrycoloured clusters there was an almost religious purity about the fresh morning air the tender sky the grass and flowers with the sheen of early dew upon them there was in all living things something limpid and joyouslike the wet morning call of the birds flying up through the unstained atmosphere out of the saffron east a thin yellow winelike sunshine began to gild the fragrant meadows and the glistening tops of the grove niel wondered why he did not often come over like this to see the day before men and their activities had spoiled it while the morning was still unsullied like a gift handed down from the heroic ages under the bluffs that overhung the marsh he came upon thickets of wild roses with flaming buds just beginning to open where they had opened their petals were stained with that burning rosecolour which is always gone by noona dye made of sunlight and morning and moisture so intense that it cannot possibly last must fade like ecstasy niel took out his knife and began to cut the stiff stems crowded with red thorns he would make a bouquet for a lovely lady a bouquet gathered off the cheeks of morning these roses only half awake in the defencelessness of utter beauty he would leave them just outside one of the french windows of her bedroom when she opened her shutters to let in the light she would find themand they would perhaps give her a sudden distaste for coarse worldlings like frank ellinger after tying his flowers with a twist of meadow grass he went up the hill through the grove and softly round the still house to the north side of mrs forresters own room where the doorlike green shutters were closed as he bent to place the flowers on the sill he heard from within a womans soft laughter impatient indulgent teasing eager then another laugh very different a mans and it was fat and lazyended in something like a yawn niel found himself at the foot of the hill on the wooden bridge his face hot his temples beating his eyes blind with anger in his hand he still carried the prickly bunch of wild roses he threw them over the wire fence into a mudhole the cattle had trampled under the bank of the creek he did not know whether he had left the house by the driveway or had come down through the shrubbery in that instant between stooping to the windowsill and rising he had lost one of the most beautiful things in his life before the dew dried the morning had been wrecked for him and all subsequent mornings he told himself bitterly this day saw the end of that admiration and loyalty that had been like a bloom on his existence he could never recapture it it was gone like the morning freshness of the flowers lilies that fester he muttered lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds grace variety the lovely voice the sparkle of fun and fancy in those dark eyes all this was nothing it was not a moral scruple she had outraged but an aesthetic ideal beautiful women whose beauty meant more than it said was their brilliancy always fed by something coarse and concealed was that their secret eight niel met his uncle and captain forrester when they alighted from the morning train and drove over to the house with them the business on which they had gone to denver was not referred to until they were sitting with mrs forrester in the front parlour the windows were open and the perfume of the mockorange and of june roses was blowing in from the garden captain forrester introduced the subject after slowly unfolding his handkerchief and wiping his forehead and his fleshy neck around his low collar maidy he said not looking at her ive come home a poor man it took about everything there was to square up youll have this place unencumbered and my pension that will be about all the livestock will bring in something niel saw that mrs forrester grew very pale but she smiled and brought her husband his cigar stand oh well i expect we can manage cant we we can just manage not much more im afraid judge pommeroy considers i acted foolishly not at all mrs forrester the judge exclaimed he acted just as i hope i would have done in his place but i am an unmarried man there were certain securities government bonds which captain forrester could have turned over to you but it would have been at the expense of the depositors ive known men to do that said the captain heavily but i never considered they paid their wives a compliment if mrs forrester is satisfied i shall never regret my decision for the first time his tired swollen eyes sought his wifes i never question your decisions in business mr forrester i know nothing about such things the captain put down the cigar he had taken but not lighted rose with an effort and walked over to the bay window where he stood gazing out over his meadows the place looks very nice maidy he said presently i see youve watered the roses they need it this weather now if youll excuse me ill lie down for a while i did not sleep well on the train niel and the judge will stay for lunch he opened the door into mrs forresters room and closed it behind him judge pommeroy began to explain to mrs forrester the situation they had faced in denver the bank about which mrs forrester knew nothing but its name was one which paid good interest on small deposits the depositors were wageearners railroad employes mechanics and day labourers many of whom had at some time worked for captain forrester his was the only wellknown name among the bank officers it was the name which promised security and fair treatment to his old workmen and their friends the other directors were promising young business men with many irons in the fire but the judge said with evident chagrin they had refused to come up to the scratch and pay their losses like gentlemen they claimed that the bank was insolvent not through unwise investments or mismanagement but because of a nationwide financial panic a shrinking in values that no one could have foreseen they argued that the fair thing was to share the loss with the depositors to pay them fifty cents on the dollar giving longtime notes for twentyfive per cent settling on a basis of seventyfive per cent captain forrester had stood firm that not one of the depositors should lose a dollar the promising young business men had listened to him respectfully but finally told him they would settle only on their own terms any additional refunding must be his affair he sent to the vault for his private steel box opened it in their presence and sorted the contents on the table the government bonds he turned in at once judge pommeroy was sent out to sell the mining stocks and other securities in the open market at this part of his narrative the judge rose and began to pace the floor twisting the seals on his watchchain that was what a man of honour was bound to do mrs forrester with five of the directors backing down he had either to lose his name or save it the depositors had put their savings into that bank because captain forrester was president to those men with no capital but their back and their two hands his name meant safety as he tried to explain to the directors those deposits were above price money saved to buy a home or to take care of a man in sickness or to send a boy to school and those young men bright fellows well thought of in the community sat there and looked down their noses and let your husband strip himself down to pledging his life insurance there was a crowd in the street outside the bank all day every day poles and swedes and mexicans looking scared to death a lot of them couldnt speak englishseemed like the only english word they knew was forrester as we went in and out wed hear the mexicans saying forrester forrester it was a torment for me on your account mam to see the captain strip himself but pon my honour i couldnt forbid him as for those white livered rascals that sat there the judge stopped before mrs forrester and ruffled his bushy white hair with both hands by god madam i think ive lived too long in my day the difference between a business man and a scoundrel was bigger than the difference between a white man and a nigger i wasnt the right one to go out there as the captains counsel one of these smooth members of the bar like ivy peters is getting ready to be might have saved something for you out of the wreck but i couldnt use my influence with your husband to that crowd outside the bank doors his name meant a hundred cents on the dollar and by god they got it im proud of him mam proud of his acquaintance it was the first time niel had ever seen mrs forrester flush a quick pink swept over her face her eyes glistened with moisture you were quite right judge i wouldnt for the world have had him do otherwise for me he would never hold up his head again you see i know him as she said this she looked at niel on the other side of the room and her glance was like a delicate and very dignified rebuke to some discourtesythough he was not conscious of having shown her any when their hostess went out to see about lunch judge pommeroy turned to his nephew son im glad you want to be an architect i cant see any honourable career for a lawyer in this new business world thats coming up leave the law to boys like ivy peters and get into some clean profession i wasnt the right man to go with forrester he shook his head sadly will they really be poor theyll be pinched its as he said theyve nothing left but this place mrs forrester returned and went to waken her husband for lunch when she opened the door into her room they heard stertorous breathing and she called to them to come quickly the captain was stretched upon his iron bed in the antechamber and mrs forrester was struggling to lift his head quick niel she panted we must get pillows under him bring those from my bed niel gently pushed her away sweat poured from his face as he got his strength under the captains shoulders it was like lifting a wounded elephant judge pommeroy hurried back to the sittingroom and telephoned dr dennison that captain forrester had had a stroke a stroke could not finish a man like daniel forrester he was kept in his bed for three weeks and niel helped mrs forrester and ben keezer take care of him although he was at the house so much during that time he never saw mrs forrester alonescarcely saw her at all indeed with so much to attend to she became abstracted almost impersonal there were many letters to answer gifts of fruit and wine and flowers to be acknowledged solicitous inquiries came from friends scattered all the way from the missouri to the mountains when mrs forrester was not in the captains room or in the kitchen preparing special foods for him she was at her desk one morning while she was seated there a distinguished visitor arrived niel waiting by the door for the letters he was to take to the post saw a large redwhiskered man in a rumpled pongee suit and a panama hat come climbing up the hill cyrus dalzell president of the colorado utah who had come over in his private car to enquire for the health of his old friend niel warned mrs forrester and she went to meet the visitor just as he mounted the steps wiping his face with a red silk bandanna he took both the ladys hands and exclaimed in a warm deep voice here she is looking as fresh as a bride may i claim an old privilege he bent his head and kissed her i wont be in your way marian he said as they came into the house but i had to see for myself how he does and how you do mr dalzell shook hands with niel and as he talked he moved about the parlour clumsily and softly like a brown bear mrs forrester stopped him to straighten his flowing yellow tie and pull down the back of his wrinkled coat its easy to see that kitty wasnt with you this morning when you dressed she laughed thank you thank you my dear ive got a green porter down there and he doesnt seem to realize the extent of his duties no kitty wanted to come but we have two giddy nieces out from portsmouth visiting us and she felt she couldnt i just had my car hitched on to the tail of the burlington flyer and came myself now tell me about daniel was it a stroke mrs forrester sat down on the sofa beside him and told him about her husbands illness while he interrupted with sympathetic questions and comments taking her hand between his large soft palms and patting it affectionately and now i can go home and tell kitty that he will soon be as good as everand that you look like you were going to lead the ball tonight you whisper to daniel that ive got a couple cases of port down in my car that will build him up faster than anything the doctors give him and ive brought along a dozen sherry for a lady that knows a thing or two about wines and next winter you are both coming out to stay with us at the springs for a change of air mrs forrester shook her head gently oh that im afraid is a pretty dream but well dream it anyway everything about her had brightened since cyrus dalzell came up the hill even the long garnet earrings beside her cheeks seemed to flash with a deeper colour niel thought she was a different woman from the one who sat there writing half an hour ago her fingers as they played on the sleeve of the pongee coat were light and fluttery as butterfly wings no dream at all my dear kitty has arranged everything you know how quickly she thinks things out i am to come for you in my car well get my old porter jim as a valet for daniel and you can just play around and put fresh life into us all we saw last winter that we couldnt do anything without our lady forrester nothing came off right without her if we had a party we sat down afterward and wondered what in hell wed had it for oh no we cant manage without you tears flashed into her eyes thats very dear of you its sweet to be remembered when one is away in her voice there was the heartbreaking sweetness one sometimes hears in lovely gentle old songs nine after three weeks the captain was up and around again he dragged his left foot and his left arm was uncertain though he recovered his speech it was thick and clouded some words he could not pronounce distinctlyslid over them dropped out a syllable therefore he avoided talking even more than was his habit the doctor said that unless another brain lesion occurred he might get on comfortably for some years yet in august niel was to go to boston to begin coaching for his entrance examinations at the massachusetts institute of technology where he meant to study architecture he put off bidding the forresters goodbye until the very day before he left his last call was different from any he had ever made there before already they began to treat him like a young man he sat rather stiffly in that parlour where he had been so much at home the captain was in his big chair in the bay window in the full glow of the afternoon sun saying little but very friendly mrs forrester on the sofa in the shadowy corner of the room talked about niels plans and his journey is it true that mary is going to marry pucelik this fall he asked her who will you get to help you no one for the present ben will do all i cant do never mind us we will pass a quiet winter like an old country coupleas we are she said lightly niel knew that she faced the winter with terror but he had never seen her more in command of herselfor more the mistress of her own house than now when she was preparing to become the servant of it he had the feeling which he never used to have that her lightness cost her something dont forget us but dont mope make lots of new friends youll never be twenty again take a chorus girl out to suppera pretty one mind dont bother about your allowance if you got into a scrape we could manage a little cheque to help you out couldnt we mr forrester the captain puffed and looked amused i think we could niel i think so dont get up my boy you must stay to dinner niel said he couldnt he hadnt finished packing and he was leaving on the morning train then we must have a little something before you go captain forrester rose heavily with the aid of his cane and went into the diningroom he brought back the decanter and filled three glasses with ceremony lifting his glass he paused as always and blinked happy days happy days echoed mrs forrester with her loveliest smile and every success to niel both the captain and his wife came to the door with him and stood there on the porch together where he had so often seen them stand to speed the parting guest he went down the hill touched and happy as he passed over the bridge his spirits suddenly fell would that chilling doubt always lie in wait for him down there in the mud where he had thrown his roses one morning he burned to ask her one question to get the truth out of her and set his mind at rest what did she do with all her exquisiteness when she was with a man like ellinger where did she put it away and having put it away how could she recover herself and give onegive even himthe sense of tempered steel a blade that could fence with anyone and never break part two one it was two years before niel herbert came home again and when he came the first acquaintance he met was ivy peters ivy got on the train at one of the little stations east of sweet water where he had been trying a case as he strolled through the pullman he noticed among the passengers a young man in a grey flannel suit with a silk shirt of one shade of blue and a necktie of another after regarding this urban figure from the rear for a few seconds ivy glanced down at his own clothes with gloating satisfaction it was a hot day in june but he wore the black felt hat and ready made coat of winter weight he had always affected as a boy he stepped forward his hands thrust in his pockets hullo niel thought i couldnt be mistaken niel looked up and saw the red beestung face with its two permanent dimples smiling down at him in contemptuous jocularity hello ivy i couldnt be mistaken in you either coming home to go into business niel replied that he was coming only for the summer vacation oh youre not through school yet i suppose it takes longer to make an architect than it does to make a shyster just as well theres not much building going on in sweet water these days youll find a good many changes wont you sit down niel indicated the neighbouring chair you are practising law yes along with a few other things have to keep more than one iron in the fire to make a living with us i farm a little on the side i rent that meadowland on the forrester place ive drained the old marsh and put it into wheat my brother john does the work and i boss the job its quite profitable i pay them a good rent and they need it i doubt if they could get along without their influential friends dont seem to help them out much remember all those chesty old boys the captain used to drive about in his democrat wagon and ship in barrels of bourbon for good deal of bluff about all those oldtimers the panic put them out of the game the forresters have come down in the world like the rest you remember how the old man used to put it over us kids and not let us carry a gun in there im just mean enough to like to shoot along that creek a little better than anywhere else now there wasnt any harm in the old captain but he had the delusion of grandeur hes happier now that hes like the rest of us and dont have to change his shirt every day ivys unblinking greenish eyes rested upon niels haberdashery niel however did not notice this he knew that ivy wanted him to show disappointment and he was determined not to do so he enquired about the captains health pointedly keeping mrs forresters name out of the conversation hes only about half there seems contented enough she takes good care of him ill say that for her she seeks consolation always did you know too much french brandy but she never neglects him i dont blame her real work comes hard on her niel heard these remarks dully through the buzz of an idea he felt that ivy had drained the marsh quite as much to spite him and mrs forrester as to reclaim the land moreover he seemed to know that until this moment ivy himself had not realized how much that consideration weighed with him he and ivy had disliked each other from childhood blindly instinctively recognizing each other through antipathy as hostile insects do by draining the marsh ivy had obliterated a few acres of something he hated though he could not name it and had asserted his power over the people who had loved those unproductive meadows for their idleness and silvery beauty after ivy had gone on into the smoker niel sat looking out at the windings of the sweet water and playing with his idea the old west had been settled by dreamers greathearted adventurers who were unpractical to the point of magnificence a courteous brotherhood strong in attack but weak in defence who could conquer but could not hold now all the vast territory they had won was to be at the mercy of men like ivy peters who had never dared anything never risked anything they would drink up the mirage dispel the morning freshness root out the great brooding spirit of freedom the generous easy life of the great land holders the space the colour the princely carelessness of the pioneer they would destroy and cut up into profitable bits as the match factory splinters the primeval forest all the way from the missouri to the mountains this generation of shrewd young men trained to petty economies by hard times would do exactly what ivy peters had done when he drained the forrester marsh two the next afternoon niel found captain forrester in the bushy little plot he called his rose garden seated in a stout hickory chair that could be left out in all weather his two canes beside him his attention was fixed upon a red block of colorado sandstone set on a granite boulder in the middle of the gravel space around which the roses grew he showed niel that this was a sundial and explained it with great pride last summer he said he sat out here a great deal with a square board mounted on a post and marked the length of the shadows by his watch his friend cyrus dalzell on one of his visits took this board away had the diagram exactly copied on sandstone and sent it to him with the columnlike boulder that formed its base i think its likely mr dalzell hunted around among the mountains a good many mornings before he found a natural formation like that said the captain a pillar such as they had in bible times its from the garden of the gods mr dalzell has his summer home up there the captain sat with the soles of his boots together his legs bowed out everything about him seemed to have grown heavier and weaker his face was fatter and smoother as if the features were running into each other as when a wax face melts in the heat an old panama hat burned yellow by the sun shaded his eyes his brown hands lay on his knees the fingers well apart nerveless his moustache was the same straw colour niel remarked to him that it had grown no greyer the captain touched his cheek with his palm mrs forrester shaved me for awhile she did it very nicely but i didnt like to have her do it now i use one of these safety razors i can manage if i take my time the barber comes over once a week mrs forrester is expecting you niel shes down in the grove she goes down there to rest in the hammock niel went round the house to the gate that gave into the grove from the top of the hill he could see the hammock slung between two cottonwoods in the low glade at the farther end where he had fallen the time he broke his arm the slender white figure was still and as he hurried across the grass he saw that a white garden hat lay over her face he approached quietly and was just wondering if she were asleep when he heard a soft delighted laugh and with a quick movement she threw off the lace hat through which she had been watching him he stepped forward and caught her suspended figure hammock and all in his arms how light and alive she was like a bird caught in a net if only he could rescue her and carry her off like thisoff the earth of sad inevitable periods away from age weariness adverse fortune she showed no impatience to be released but lay laughing up at him with that gleam of something elegantly wild something fantastic and tantalizingseemingly so artless really the most finished artifice she put her hand under his chin as if he were still a boy and how handsome hes grown isnt the old judge proud of you he called me up last night and began sputtering its only fair to warn you mam that ive a very handsome boy over here as if i hadnt known you would be and now youre a man and have seen the world well what have you found in it nothing so nice as you mrs forrester nonsense you have sweethearts perhaps are they pretty why they isnt one enough one is too many i want you to have half a dozenand still save the best for us one would take everything if you had her you would not have come home at all i wonder if you know how weve looked for you she took his hand and turned a seal ring about on his little finger absently every night for weeks when the lights of the train came swinging in down below the meadows ive said to myself niel is coming home theres that to look forward to she caught herself as she always did when she found that she was telling too much and finished in a playful tone so you see you mean a great deal to all of us did you find mr forrester oh yes i had to stop and look at his sundial she raised herself on her elbow and lowered her voice niel can you understand it he isnt childish as some people say but he will sit and watch that thing hour after hour how can anybody like to see time visibly devoured we are all used to seeing clocks go round but why does he want to see that shadow creep on that stone has he changed much no im glad you feel so now tell me about the adamses and what george is like niel dropped on the turf and sat with his back against a tree trunk answering her rapid questions and watching her while he talked of course she was older in the brilliant sun of the afternoon one saw that her skin was no longer like white lilacs it had the ivory tint of gardenias that have just begun to fade the coil of blueblack hair seemed more than ever too heavy for her head there were linessomething strained about the corners of her mouth that used not to be there but the astonishing thing was how these changes could vanish in a moment be utterly wiped out in a flash of personality and one forgot everything about her except herself and tell me niel do women really smoke after dinner now with the men nice women i shouldnt like it its all very well for actresses but women cant be attractive if they do everything that men do i think just now its the fashion for women to make themselves comfortable before anything else mrs forrester glanced at him as if he had said something shocking ah thats just it the two things dont go together athletics and going to college and smoking after dinnerdo you like it dont men like women to be different from themselves they used to niel laughed yes that was certainly the idea of mrs forresters generation uncle judge says you dont come to see him any more as you used to mrs forrester he misses it my dear boy i havent been over to the town for six weeks im always too tired we have no horse now and when i do go i have to walk that house nothing is ever done there unless i do it and nothing ever moves unless i move it thats why i come down here in the afternoonto get where i cant see the house i cant keep it up as it should be kept im not strong enough oh yes ben helps me he sweeps and beats the rugs and washes windows but that doesnt get a house very far mrs forrester sat up suddenly and pinned on her white hat we went all the way to chicago niel to buy that walnut furniture couldnt find anything at home big and heavy enough if id known that one day id have to push it about i would have been more easily satisfied she rose and shook out her rumpled skirts they started toward the house going slowly up the long grassy undulation between the trees dont you miss the marsh niel asked suddenly she glanced away evasively not much i would never have time to go there and we need the money it pays us and you havent time to play any more either niel you must hurry and become a successful man your uncle is terribly involved he has been so careless that hes not much better off than we are money is a very important thing realize that in the beginning face it and dont be ridiculous in the end like so many of us they stopped by the gate at the top of the hill and looked back at the green alleys and sharp shadows at the quivering fans of light that seemed to push the trees farther apart and made elysian fields underneath them mrs forrester put her white hand with all its rings on niels arm do you really find a kind of pleasure in coming back to us thats very unusual i think at your age i wanted to be with the young and gay its nice for us though she looked at him with her rarest smile one he had seldom seen on her face but always remembereda smile without archness without gaiety full of affection and wistfully sad and the same thing was in her voice when she spoke those quiet wordsthe sudden quietness of deep feeling she turned quickly away they went through the gate and around the house to where the captain sat watching the sunset glory on his roses his wife touched his shoulder will you go in now mr forrester or shall i bring your coat ill go in isnt niel going to stay for dinner not this time hell come soon and well have a real dinner for him will you wait for mr forrester niel i must hurry in and start the fire niel tarried behind and accompanied the captains slow progress toward the front of the house he leaned upon two canes lifting his feet slowly and putting them down firmly and carefully he looked like an old tree walking once up the steps and into the parlour he sank into his big chair and panted heavily the first whiff of a fresh cigar seemed to restore him can i trouble you to mail some letters for me niel as you go by the postoffice he produced them from the breast pocket of his summer coat let me see whether mrs forrester has anything to go rising the captain went into the little hall there by the front door on a table under the hat rack was a scantily draped figure an arab or egyptian slave girl holding in her hands a large flat shell from the california coast niel remembered noticing that figure the first time he was ever in the house when dr dennison carried him out through this hallway with his arm in splints in the days when the forresters had servants and were sending over to the town several times a day the letters for the post were always left in this shell the captain found one now and handed it to niel it was addressed to mr francis bosworth ellinger glenwood springs colorado for some reason niel felt embarrassed and tried to slip the letter quickly into his pocket the captain his two canes in one hand prevented him he took the pale blue envelope again and held it out at arms length regarding it mrs forrester is a fine penman have you ever noticed always was if she made me a list of articles to get at the store i never had to hide it it was like copper plate thats exceptional in a woman niel niel remembered her hand well enough he had never seen another in the least like it long thin angular letters curiously delicate and curiously bold looped and laced with strokes fine as a hair and perfectly distinct her script looked as if it had been done at a high pitch of speed the pen driven by a perfectly confident dexterity oh yes captain im never able to take any letters for mrs forrester without looking at them no one could forget her writing yes its very exceptional the captain gave him the envelope and with his canes went slowly toward his big chair niel had often wondered just how much the captain knew now as he went down the hill he felt sure that he knew everything more than anyone else all there was to know about marian forrester three niel had planned to do a great deal of reading in the forresters grove that summer but he did not go over so often as he had intended the frequent appearance of ivy peters about the place irritated him ivy visited his new wheat fields on the bottom land very often and he always took the old path that led from what was once the marsh up the steep bank and through the grove he was likely to appear at any hour his trousers stuffed into his top boots tramping along between the rows of trees with an air of proprietorship he shut the gate behind the house with a slam and went whistling through the yard often he stopped at the kitchen door to call out some pleasantry to mrs forrester this annoyed niel for at that hour of the morning when she was doing her housework mrs forrester was not dressed to receive her inferiors it was one thing to greet the president of the colorado utah en deshabille but it was another to chatter with a coarsegrained fellow like ivy peters in her wrapper and slippers her sleeves rolled up and her throat bare to his cool impudent eyes sometimes ivy strode through the rose plot where captain forrester was sitting in the sunwent by without looking at him as if there were no one there if he spoke to the captain at all he did so as if he were addressing someone incapable of understanding anything hullo captain aint afraid this sun will spoil your complexion or well captain youll have to get the prayer meetings to take up this rain question the droughts damned bad for my wheat one morning as niel was coming up through the grove he heard laughter by the gate and there he saw ivy with his gun talking to mrs forrester she was bareheaded her skirts blowing in the wind her arm through the handle of a big tin bucket that rested on the fence beside her ivy stood with his hat on his head but there was in his attitude that unmistakable something which shows that a man is trying to make himself agreeable to a woman he was telling her a funny story probably an improper one for it brought out her naughtiest laugh with something nervous and excited in it as if he were going too far at the end of his story ivy himself broke into his farmhand guffaw mrs forrester shook her ringer at him and catching up her pail ran back into the house she bent a little with its weight but ivy made no offer to carry it for her he let her trip away with it as if she were a kitchen maid and that were her business niel emerged from the grove and stopped where the captain sat in the garden goodmorning captain forrester was that ivy peters who just went through here that fellow hasnt the manners of a pig he blurted out the captain pointed to mrs forresters empty chair sit down niel sit down he drew his handkerchief from his pocket and began polishing his glasses no he said quietly he aint overly polite more than if he had complained bitterly that guarded admission made one feel how much he had been hurt and offended by ivys rudeness there was something very sad in his voice and helpless from his equals respect had always come to him as his due from fellows like ivy he had been able to command itto order them off his place or dismiss them from his employ niel sat down and smoked a cigar with him they had a long talk about the building of the black hills branch of the burlington in boston last winter niel had met an old mineowner who was living in deadwood when the railroad first came in when niel asked him if he had known daniel forrester the old gentleman said forrester was he the one with the beautiful wife you must tell her said the captain stroking the warm surface of his sundial yes indeed you must tell mrs forrester one night in the first week of july a night of glorious moonlight niel found himself unable to read or to stay indoors at all he walked aimlessly down the wide empty street and crossed the first creek by the footbridge the wide ripe fields the whole country seemed like a sleeping garden one trod the dusty roads softly not to disturb the deep slumber of the world in the forrester lane the scent of sweet clover hung heavy it had always grown tall and green here ever since niel could remember the captain would never let it be cut until the weeds were mowed in the fall the black plumelike shadows of the poplars fell across the lane and over ivy peters wheat fields as he walked on niel saw a white figure standing on the bridge over the second creek motionless in the clear moonlight he hurried forward mrs forrester was looking down at the water where it flowed bright over the pebbles he came up beside her the captain is asleep oh yes long ago he sleeps well thank heaven after i tuck him in i have nothing more to worry about while they were standing there talking in low voices they heard a heavy door slam on the hill mrs forrester started and looked back over her shoulder a man emerged from the shadow of the house and came striding down the driveway ivy peters stepped upon the bridge good evening he said to mrs forrester neither calling her by name nor removing his hat i see you have company ive just been up looking at the old barn to see if the stalls are fit to put horses in there tomorrow im going to start cutting wheat in the morning and well have to put the horses in your stable at noon wed lose time taking them back to town why certainly the horses can go in our barn im sure mr forrester would have no objection she spoke as if he had asked her permission oh ivy shrugged the men will begin down here at six oclock i wont get over till about ten and i have to meet a client at my office at three maybe you could give me some lunch to save time his impudence made her smile very well then i invite you to lunch we lunch at one thanks it will help me out as if he had forgotten himself he lifted his hat and went down the lane swinging it in his hand niel stood looking after him why do you allow him to speak to you like that mrs forrester if youll let me ill give him a beating and teach him how to speak to you no no niel remember we have to get along with ivy peters we simply have to there was a note of anxiety in her voice and she caught his arm you dont have to take anything from him or to stand his bad manners anybody else would pay you as much for the land as he does but he has a lease for five years and he could make it very disagreeable for us dont you see besides she spoke hurriedly theres more than that hes invested a little money for me in wyoming in land he gets splendid land from the indians some way for next to nothing dont tell your uncle ive no doubt its crooked but the judge is like mr forrester his methods dont work nowadays he will never get us out of debt dear man he cant get himself out ivy peters is terribly smart you know he owns half the town already not quite said niel grimly hes got hold of a good deal of property hell take advantage of anybodys necessity you know hes utterly unscrupulous dont you why didnt you let mr dalzell or some of your other old friends invest your money for you oh it was too little only a few hundred dollars id saved on the housekeeping they would put it into something safe at six per cent i know you dont like ivyand he knows it hes always at his worst before you hes not so bad asas his face for instance she laughed nervously he honestly wants to help us out of the hole were in coming and going all the time as he does he sees everything and i really think he hates to have me work so hard next time you have anything to invest you let me take it to mr dalzell and explain ill promise to do as well by you as ivy peters can mrs forrester took his arm and drew him into the lane but my dear boy you know nothing about these business schemes youre not clever that wayits one of the things i love you for i dont admire people who cheat indians indeed i dont she shook her head vehemently mrs forrester rascality isnt the only thing that succeeds in business it succeeds faster than anything else though she murmured absently they walked as far as the end of the lane and turned back again mrs forresters hand tightened on his arm she began speaking abruptly you see two years three years more of this and i could still go back to californiaand live again but after that perhaps people think ive settled down to grow old gracefully but ive not i feel such a power to live in me niel her slender fingers gripped his wrist its grown by being held back last winter i was with the dalzells at glenwood springs for three weeks i owe that to ivy peters he looked after things here and his sister kept house for mr forrester and i was surprised at myself i could dance all night and not feel tired i could ride horseback all day and be ready for a dinner party in the evening i had no clothes of course old evening dresses with yards and yards of satin and velvet in them that mrs dalzells sewing woman made over but i looked well enough yes i did i always know how im looking and i looked well enough the men thought so i looked happier than any woman there they were nearly all younger much but they seemed dull bored to death after a glass or two of champagne they went to sleep and had nothing to say i always look better after the first glass it gives me a little colour its the only thing that does i accepted the dalzells invitation with a purpose i wanted to see whether i had anything left worth saving and i have i tell you you would hardly believe it i could hardly believe it but i still have by this time they had reached the bridge a bare white floor in the moonlight mrs forrester had been quickening her pace all the while so thats what im struggling for to get out of this holeshe looked about as if she had fallen into a deep well out of it when im alone here for months together i plan and plot if it werent for that as niel walked back to his room behind the law offices he felt frightened for her when women began to talk about still feeling young didnt it mean that something had broken two or three years she said he shivered only yesterday old dr dennison had proudly told him that captain forrester might live a dozen we are keeping his general health up remarkably and he was originally a man of iron what hope was there for her he could still feel her hand upon his arm as she urged him faster and faster up the lane four the weather was dry and intensely hot for several weeks and then at the end of july thunderstorms and torrential rains broke upon the sweet water valley the river burst out of its banks all the creeks were up and the stubble of ivy peters wheat fields lay under water a wide lake and two rushing creeks now separated the forresters from the town ben keezer rode over to them every day to do the chores and to take them their mail one evening ben with his slicker and leather mailbag had just come out of the postoffice and was preparing to mount his horse when niel herbert stopped him to ask in a low voice whether he had got the denver paper oh yes i always wait for the papers she likes to have them to read of an evening guess its pretty lonesome over there he swung into his saddle and splashed off niel walked slowly around to the hotel for dinner he had found something very disconcerting in the denver paper frank ellingers picture on the society page along with constance ogdens they had been married yesterday at colorado springs and were stopping at the antlers after supper niel put on his rubber coat and started for the forresters when he reached the first creek he found that the footbridge had been washed out from the far bank and lay obliquely in the stream battered at by the yellow current which might at any moment carry it away one could not cross the ford without a horse he looked irresolutely across the submerged bottom lands the house was dark no lights in the parlour windows the rain was beginning to fall again perhaps she had rather be alone tonight he would go over tomorrow he went back to the law office and tried to make himself comfortable though the place was in distracting disorder the continued rain had set one of the chimneys leaking had brought down streams of soot and black water and flooded the stove and the judges once handsome brussels carpet the tinner had been there all afternoon trying to find what was the matter with the flue cutting a new sheetiron drawer to fit under the stovepipe but at six oclock he had gone away leaving tools and sheets of metal lying about the rooms were damp and cold niel put on a heavy sweater since he could not have a fire lit the big coaloil lamp and sat down with a book when at last he looked at his watch it was nearly midnight and he had been reading three hours he would have another pipe and go to bed he had scarcely lit it when he heard quick hurrying footsteps in the echoing corridor outside he got to the door in an instant was there to open it before mrs forrester had time to knock he caught her by the arm and pulled her in everything but her wet white face was hidden by a black rubber hat and a coat that was much too big for her streams of water trickled from the coat and when she opened it he saw that she was drenched to the waisther black dress clung in a muddy pulp about her mrs forrester he cried you cant have crossed the creek its up to a horses belly in the ford i came over the bridge whats left of it it shook under me but im not heavy she threw off her hat and wiped the water from her face with her hands why didnt you ask ben to bring you over on his horse here please swallow this she pushed his hand aside wait afterwards ben i didnt think until after he was gone its the telephone i want long distance get me colorado springs the antlers quick then niel noticed that she smelled strong of spirits it steamed above the smell of rubber and creek mud and wet cloth she snatched up the desk telephone but he gently took it from her ill get them for you but youre in no condition to talk now youre out of breath do you really want to talk tonight you know mrs beasley will hear every word you say mrs beasley was the sweet water central and an indefatigable reporter of everything that went over the wires mrs forrester sitting in his uncles desk chair tapped the carpet with the toe of her rubber boot do hurry please she said in that polite warning tone of which even ivy peters was afraid niel aroused the sleepy central and put in the call she asks whom you wish to speak to frank ellinger say judge pommeroys office wishes to speak to him niel began soothing mrs beasley at the other end no not the management mrs beasley one of the guests frank ellinger he spelled the name yes judge pommeroys office wants to talk to him ill be right here as soon as you can please he put down the instrument id rather you know publish anything in the town paper than telephone it through mrs beasley mrs forrester paid no heed to him did not look at him sat staring at the wall i cant see why you didnt call me up and ask me to bring a horse over for you if you felt you must get to a long distance telephone tonight yes i didnt think of it i only knew i had to get over here and i was afraid something might stop me she was watching the telephone as if it were alive her eyes were shrunk to hard points her brows drawn together in an acute angle kept twitching in the frown which held themthe singular frown of one overcome by alcohol or fatigue who is holding on to consciousness by the strength of a single purpose her blue lips the black shadows under her eyes made her look as if some poison were at work in her body they waited and waited niel understood that she did not wish him to talk her mind was struggling with something with every blink of her lashes she seemed to face it anew presently she rose as if she could bear the suspense no longer and went over to the window leaned against it did you leave captain forrester alone niel asked suddenly yes nothing will happen over there nothing ever does happen she answered wildly wringing her hands the telephone buzzed mrs forrester darted toward the desk but niel lifted the instrument in his left hand and barred her way with his right try to be calm mrs forrester when i get ellinger i will let you talk to himand central will hear every word you say remember after some exchanges with the colorado office he pointed her to the chair sit down and ill give it to you he is on the wire he did not dare to leave her alone though it was awkward enough to be a listener he walked to the window and stood with his back to the desk where she was sitting is that you frank this is marian i wont keep you a moment you were asleep so early thats not like you youve reformed already havent you thats what marriage does they say no i wasnt altogether surprised you might have taken me into your confidence though havent i deserved it a long listening pause niel stared stupidly at the dark window he had steeled his nerves for wild reproaches the voice he heard behind him was her most charming playful affectionate intimate with a thrill of pleasant excitement that warmed its slight formality and burned through the commonplace words like the colour in an opal he simply held his breath while she fluttered on where shall you go for your honeymoon oh im very sorry so soon you must take good care of her give her my love i should think california at this time of the year might be right it went on like this for some minutes the voice it seemed to niel was that of a woman young beautiful happywarm and at her ease sitting in her own drawingroom and talking on a stormy night to a dear friend far away oh unusually well for me stop and see for yourself you will be going to omaha on business next week before california oh yes you will stop off between trains you know how welcome you are always a long pause an exclamation from mrs forrester made niel turn sharply round now it was coming her voice was darkening with every word i think i understand you you are not speaking from your own room what from the office booth oh then i understand you very well indeed niel looked about in alarm it was time to stop her but how the voice went on play safe when have you ever played anything else you know frank the truth is that youre a coward a great hulking coward do you hear me i want you to hear youve got a safe thing at last i should think safe and pasty how much stock did you get with it a big block i hope now let me tell you the truth i dont want you to come here i never want to see you again while i live and i forbid you to come and look at me when im dead i dont want your hateful eyes to look at my dead face do you hear me why dont you answer me dont dare to hang up the receiver you coward oh you big frank frank say something oh hes shut me off i cant hear him she flung the receiver down dropped her head on the desk and broke into heavy groaning sobs niel stood over her and waited with composure for once he had been quick enough he had saved her the moment that quivering passion of hatred and wrong leaped into her voice he had taken the big shears left by the tinner and cut the insulated wire behind the desk her reproaches had got no farther than this room when the sobs ceased he touched her shoulder he shook her but there was no response she was asleep sunk in a heavy stupor her hands and face were so cold that he thought there could not be a drop of warm blood left in her body he carried her into his room cut off her drenched clothing wrapped her in his bathrobe and put her into his own bed she was absolutely unconscious he blew out the light locked her in and left the building going as fast as he could to judge pommeroys cottage he roused his uncle and briefly explained the situation can you dress and go down to the office for the rest of the night uncle judge some one must be with her and ill get over to the captain at once he certainly oughtnt to be left alone if she could get across the bridge i guess i can by the way she began talking wild and i cut the telephone wire behind your desk so keep an eye on it it might make trouble on a stormy night like this ill get a livery hack and take mrs forrester home in the morning before the town is awake when daylight began to break niel went into captain forresters room and told him that his wife had been sent for in the night to answer a long distance telephone call and that now he was going to bring her home the captain lay propped up on three big pillows since his face had grown fat and relaxed its ruggedness had changed to an almost asiatic smoothness he looked like a wise old chinese mandarin as he lay listening to the young mans fantastic story with perfect composure merely blinking and saying thank you niel thank you as niel went through the sleeping town on his way to the livery barn he saw the short plump figure of mrs beasley like a boiled pudding sewed up in a blue kimono waddling through the feathery asparagus bed behind the telephone office she had already been next door to tell her neighbour molly tucker the seamstress the story of her exciting night five soon afterward when captain forrester had another stroke mrs beasley and molly tucker and their friends were perfectly agreed that it was a judgment upon his wife no judgment could have been crueller under the care of him now that he was helpless mrs forrester quite went to pieces even after their misfortunes had begun to come upon them she had maintained her old reserve she had asked nothing and accepted nothing her demeanour toward the townspeople was always the same easy cordial and impersonal her own friends had moved away long agoall except judge pommeroy and dr dennison when any of the housewives from the town came to call she met them in the parlour chatted with them in the smiling careless manner they could never break through and they got no further they still felt they must put on their best dress and carry a cardcase when they went to the forresters but now that the captain was helpless everything changed she could hold off the curious no longer the townswomen brought soups and custards for the invalid when they came to sit out the night with him she turned the house over to them she was worn out so exhausted that she was dull to what went on about her the mrs beasleys and molly tuckers had their chance at last they went in and out of mrs forresters kitchen as familiarly as they did out of one anothers they rummaged through the linen closet to find more sheets pried about in the attic and cellar they went over the house like ants the house where they had never before got past the parlour and they found they had been fooled all these years there was nothing remarkable about the place at all the kitchen was inconvenient the sink was smelly the carpets were worn the curtains faded the clumsy oldfashioned furniture they wouldnt have had for a gift and the upstairs bedrooms were full of dust and cobwebs judge pommeroy remarked to his nephew that he had never seen these women look so wideawake so important and pleased with themselves as now when he encountered them bustling about the forrester place the captains illness had the effect of a social revival like a new club or a church society the creatures grew bolder and bolderand mrs forrester apparently had no power of resistance she drudged in the kitchen slept halfdressed in one of the chambers upstairs kept herself going on black coffee and brandy all the bars were down she had ceased to care about anything as the women came and went through the lane niel sometimes overheard snatches of their conversation why didnt she sell some of that silver all those platters and covered dishes stuck away with the tarnish of years on them i wouldnt mind having some of her linen theres a chest full of double damask upstairs every tablecloth long enough to make two did you ever see anything like the wine glasses ill bet theres not as many in both saloons put together if she has a sale after hes gone ill buy a dozen champagne glasses theyre nice to serve sherbet in there are nine dozen glasses said molly tucker counting them for beer and whiskey if there is a sale ive a mind to bid in a couple of them green ones with long stems for mantel ornaments but shell never sell em all unless she can get the saloons to take em ed elliotts mother laughed shell never sell em as long as shes got anything to put in em the cellar will go dry some day i guess theres always plenty that will get it for such as her i never go there now that i dont smell it on her i went over late the other night and she was on her knees washing up the kitchen floor her eyes were glassy she kept washing the place around the icebox over and over till it made me nervous i said mrs forrester i think youve washed that place several times already was she confused not a particle she laughed and said she was often absent minded mrs elliotts companions laughed too and agreed that absent minded was a good expression niel repeated this conversation to his uncle uncle he declared i dont see how i can go back to boston and leave the forresters id like to chuck school for a year and see them through i want to go over there and clear those gossips out could you stay at the hotel for a few weeks and let me have black tom with him to help me id send every one of those women trotting down the lane it was arranged quietly and at once tom was put in the kitchen and niel himself took charge of the nursing he met the women with firmness they were very kind but now nothing was needed the doctor had said the house must be absolutely quiet and that the invalid must see no one once the house was tranquil mrs forrester went to bed and slept for the better part of a week the captain himself improved on his good days he could be put into a wheelchair and rolled out into his garden to enjoy the september sunlight and the last of his briar roses thank you niel thank you tom he often said when they lifted him into his chair i value this quiet very highly if a day came when they thought he ought not to go out he was sad and disappointed better get him out no matter what said mrs forrester he likes to look at his place that and his cigar are the only pleasures he has left when she was rested and in command of herself again she took her place in the kitchen and black tom went back to the judge at night when he was alone when mrs forrester had gone to bed and the captain was resting quietly niel found a kind of solemn happiness in his vigils it had been hard to give up that year most of his classmates were younger than he it had cost him something but now that he had taken the step he was glad as he put in the night hours sitting first in one chair and then in another reading smoking getting a lunch to keep himself awake he had the satisfaction of those who keep faith he liked being alone with the old things that had seemed so beautiful to him in his childhood these were still the most comfortable chairs in the world and he would never like any pictures so well as william tells chapel and the house of the tragic poet no cardtable was so good for solitaire as this old one with a stone top mosaic in the pattern of a chessboard which one of the captains friends had brought him from naples no other house could take the place of this one in his life he had time to think of many things of himself and of his old friends here he had noticed that often when mrs forrester was about her work the captain would call to her maidy maidy and she would reply yes mr forrester from wherever she happened to be but without coming to himas if she knew that when he called to her in that tone he was not asking for anything he wanted to know if she were near perhaps or perhaps he merely liked to call her name and to hear her answer the longer niel was with captain forrester in those peaceful closing days of his life the more he felt that the captain knew his wife better even than she knew herself and that knowing her heto use one of his own expressionsvalued her six captain forresters death which occurred early in december was telegraphic news the only state news that the discouraged town of sweet water had furnished for a long while flowers and telegrams came from east and west but it happened that none of the captains closest friends could come to his funeral mr dalzell was in california the president of the burlington railroad was travelling in europe the others were far away or in uncertain health doctor dennison and judge pommeroy were the only two of his intimates among the pallbearers on the morning of the funeral when the captain was already in his coffin and the undertaker was in the parlour setting up chairs niel heard a knocking at the kitchen door there he found adolph blum carrying a large white box niel he said will you please give these to mrs forrester and tell her they are from rhein and me for the captain adolph was in his old working clothes the only clothes he had probably with a knitted comforter about his neck niel knew he wouldnt come to the funeral so he said wont you come in and see him dolph he looks just like himself adolph hesitated but he caught sight of the undertakers man through the parlour baywindow and said no thank you niel thrust his red hands into his jacket pockets and walked away niel took the flowers out of the box a great armful of yellow roses which must have cost the price of many a dead rabbit he carried them upstairs where mrs forrester was lying down these are from the blum boys he said adolph just brought them to the kitchen door mrs forrester looked at them then turned away her head on the pillow her lips trembling it was the only time that day he saw her pale composure break the funeral was large old settlers and farmer folk came from all over the county to follow the pioneers body to the grave as niel and his uncle were driving back from the cemetery with mrs forrester she spoke for the first time since they had left the house judge pommeroy she said quietly i think i will have mr forresters sundial taken over and put above his grave i can have an inscription cut on the base it seems more appropriate for him than any stone we could buy and i will plant some of his own rosebushes beside it when they got back to the house it was four oclock and she insisted upon making tea for them i would like it myself and it is better to be doing something wait for me in the parlour and niel move the things back as we always have them the grey day was darkening and as the three sat having their tea in the baywindow swift squalls of snow were falling over the wide meadows between the hill and the town and the creaking of the big cottonwoods about the house seemed to say that winter had come seven one morning in april niel was alone in the law office his uncle had been ill with rheumatic fever for a long while and he had been attending to the routine of business the door opened and a figure stood there strange and yet familiarhe had to think a moment before he realized that it was orville ogden who used to come to sweet water so often but who had not been seen there now for several years he didnt look a day older one eye was still direct and clear the other clouded and oblique he still wore a stiff imperial and twisted moustache the grey colour of old beeswax and his thin hair was brushed heroically up over the bald spot this is judge pommeroys nephew isnt it i cant think of your name my boy but i remember you is the judge out please be seated mr ogden my uncle is ill he hasnt been at the office for several months hes had really a very bad time of it is there anything i can do for you oh im sorry to hear that im sorry he spoke as if he were i guess all we fellows are getting older whether we like it or not it made a great difference when daniel forrester went mr ogden took off his overcoat put his hat and gloves neatly on the desk and then seemed somewhat at a loss what is your uncles trouble he asked suddenly niel told him i was to have gone back to school this winter but uncle begged me to stay and look after things for him there was no one here he wanted to entrust his business to i see i see said mr ogden thoughtfully then you do attend to his business for the present he paused and reflected yes there was something that i wanted to take up with him i am stopping off for a few hours only between trains i might speak to you about it and you could consult your uncle and write me in chicago its a confidential matter and concerns another person niel assured him of his discretion but mr ogden seemed to find the subject difficult to approach he looked very grave and slowly lit a cigar it is simply he said at last a rather delicate suggestion i wish to make to your uncle about one of his clients i have several friends in the government at washington just at present friends who would go out of their way to serve me i have been thinking that we might manage it to get a special increase of pension for mrs forrester i am due in chicago this week and after my business there is finished i would be quite willing to go on to washington to see what can be done provided of course that no one least of all your uncles client knows of my activity in the matter niel flushed im sorry mr ogden he brought out but mrs forrester is no longer a client of my uncles after the captains death she saw fit to take her business away from him mr ogdens normal eye became as blank as the other whats that he isnt her lawyer why for twenty years i know that sir she didnt treat him with much consideration she transferred her business very abruptly to whom may i ask to a lawyer here in town ivy peters peters i never heard of him no you wouldnt have he wasnt one of the people who went to the forrester house in the old days hes one of the younger generation a few years older than i he rented part of the forresters land for several years before the captains deathwas their tenant that was how mrs forrester came to know him she thinks him a good business man mr ogden frowned and is he some people think so is he trustworthy far from it he takes the cases nobody else will take he may treat mrs forrester honestly but if he does it will not be from principle this is very distressing news go on with your work my boy i must think this over mr ogden rose and walked about the room his hands behind him niel turned to an unfinished letter on his desk in order to leave his visitor the more free mr ogdens position he understood was a difficult one he had been devoted to mrs forrester and before constance had made up her mind to marry frank ellinger before the mother and daughter began to angle for him mr ogden had come to the forresters more frequently than any of their denver friends he hadnt been back niel believed since that christmas party when he and his family were there with ellinger very soon afterward he must have seen what his womenfolk were up to and whether he approved or disapproved he must have decided that there was nothing for him to do but to keep out it hadnt been the forresters reversal of fortune that had kept him away one could see that he was deeply troubled that he had her heavily on his mind niel had finished his letter and was beginning another when mr ogden stopped beside his desk where he stood twisting his imperial tighter and tighter you say this young lawyer is unprincipled sometimes rascals have a soft spot a sentiment where women are concerned niel stared he immediately thought of ivys dimples a soft spot a sentiment mr ogden why not go to his office a glance would convince you oh thats not necessary i understand he looked out of the window from which he could just see the treetops of the forrester grove and murmured poor lady so misguided she ought to have advice from some of daniels friends he took out his watch and consulted it turning something over in his mind his train was due in an hour he said nothing could be done at present in a few moments he left the office afterward niel felt sure that when mr ogden stood there uncertainly watch in hand he was considering an interview with mrs forrester he had wanted to go to her and had given it up was he afraid of his womenfolk or was it another kind of cowardice the fear of losing a pleasant memory of finding her changed and marred a dread of something that would throw a disenchanting light upon the past niel had heard his uncle say that mr ogden admired pretty women though he had married a homely one and that in his deep noncommittal way he was very gallant perhaps with a little encouragement he would have gone to see mrs forrester and he might have helped her the fact that he had done nothing to bring this about made niel realize how much his own feeling toward that lady had changed it was mrs forrester herself who had changed since her husbands death she seemed to have become another woman for years niel and his uncle the dalzells and all her friends had thought of the captain as a drag upon his wife a care that drained her and dimmed her and kept her from being all that she might be but without him she was like a ship without ballast driven hither and thither by every wind she was flighty and perverse she seemed to have lost her faculty of discrimination her power of easily and graciously keeping everyone in his proper place ivy peters had been in wyoming at the time of captain forresters illness and deathcalled away by a telegram which announced that oil had been discovered near his landholdings he returned soon after the captains funeral however and was seen about the forrester place more than ever as there was nothing to be done on his fields in the winter he had amused himself by pulling down the old barn after office hours one was likely to come upon him smoking his cigar on the front porch as if he owned the place he often spent the evening there playing cards with mrs forrester or talking about his business projects he had not made his fortune yet but he was on the way to it occasionally he took a friend or two some of the town boys over to dine at mrs forresters the boys mothers and sweethearts were greatly scandalized now shes after the young ones said ed elliotts mother shes getting childish at last niel had a plain talk with mrs forrester he told her that people were gossiping about ivys being there so much he had heard comments even on the street but i cant bother about their talk they have always talked about me always will mr peters is my lawyer and my tenant i have to see him and im certainly not going to his office i cant sit in the house alone every evening and knit if you came to see me any oftener than you do that would make talk you are still younger than ivyand betterlooking did that never occur to you i wish you wouldnt talk to me like that he said coldly mrs forrester why dont you go away to california to people of your own kind you know this town is no place for you i mean to just as soon as i can sell this place its all i have and if i leave it to tenants it will run down and i cant sell it to advantage thats why ivy is here so much hes trying to make the place presentable pulling down the old barn that had become an eyesore putting new boards in the porch floor where the old ones had rotted next summer i am going to paint the house unless i keep the place up i can never get my price for it she talked nervously with exaggerated earnestness as if she were trying to persuade herself and what are you asking for it now mrs forrester twenty thousand dollars youll never get it at least not until times have greatly changed thats what your uncle said he wouldnt attempt to sell it for more than twelve thats why i had to put it into other hands times have changed but he doesnt realize it mr forrester himself told me it would be worth that ivy says he can get me twenty thousand or if not he will take it off my hands as soon as his investments begin to bring in returns and in the meantime you are simply wasting your life here not altogether she looked at him with pleading plausibility i am getting rested after a long strain and while i wait im finding new friends among the young menthose your age and a little younger ive wanted for a long while to do something for the boys in this town but my hands were full i hate to see them growing up like savages when all they need is a civilized house to come to and a woman to give them a few hints theyve never had a chance you wouldnt be the boy you are if youd never gone to bostonand youve always had older friends whod seen better days suppose you had grown up like ed elliott and joe simpson i flatter myself i wouldnt be exactly like them if i had however there is no use discussing it if youve thought it over and made up your mind i spoke of it because i thought you mightnt realize how it strikes the townspeople i know she tossed her head her eyes glittered but there was no mirth in themit was more like hysterical defiance i know they call me the merry widow i rather like it niel left the house without further argument and though that was three weeks ago he had not been back since mrs forrester had called to see his uncle in the meantime the judge was as courtly as ever in his manner toward her but he was deeply hurt by her defection and his cherishing care for her would never be revived he had attended to all captain forresters business for twenty years and since the failure of the denver bank had never deducted a penny for fees from the money entrusted to him mrs forrester had treated him very badly she had given him no warning one day ivy peters had come into the office with a written order from her requesting that an accounting and all funds and securities be turned over to him since then she had never spoken of the matter to the judgeor to niel save in that conversation about the sale of the property eight one morning when a warm may wind was whirling the dust up the street mrs forrester came smiling into judge pommeroys office wearing a new spring bonnet and a short black velvet cape fastened at the neck with a bunch of violets please be nice enough to notice my new clothes niel she said coaxingly they are the first ive had in years and years he told her they were very pretty and arent you glad i have some at last she smiled enquiringly through her veil i feel as if you werent going to be cross with me today and would do what i ask you its nothing very troublesome i want you to come to dinner friday night if you come there will be eight of us counting annie peters they are all boys you know and if you dont like them you ought to yes you ought to she nodded at him severely since you mind what people say niel arent you afraid theyll be saying youre a snob just because youve been to boston and seen a little of the world you mustnt be so stiff soso superior it isnt becoming at your age she drew her brows down into a level frown so like his own that he laughed he had almost forgotten her old talent for mimicry what do you want me for you used always to say it was no good asking people who didnt mix you can mix well enough if you take the trouble and this time you will for me wont you when she was gone niel was angry with himself for having been persuaded on friday evening he was the last guest to arrive it was a warm night after a hot day the windows were open and the perfume of the lilacs came into the dusky parlour where the boys were sitting about in chairs that seemed too big for them a lamp was burning in the diningroom and there ivy peters stood at the sideboard mixing cocktails his sister annie was in the kitchen helping the hostess mrs forrester came in for a moment to greet niel then excused herself and hurried back to annie peters through the open door he saw that the silver dishes had reappeared on the dinner table and the candlesticks and flowers the young men who sat about in the twilight would not know the difference he thought if she had furnished her table that morning from the stock in wernzs queensware store their conception of a really fine dinner service was one hand painted by a sister or sweetheart each boy sat with his legs crossed one tan shoe swinging in the air and displaying a tan silk sock they were talking about clothes joe simpson who had just inherited his fathers clothing business was eager to tell them what the summer styles would be ivy peters came in shaking his drinks you fellows are like a bunch of girlsalways talking about what you are going to wear and how you can spend your money simpson wouldnt get rich very fast if you all wore your clothes as long as i do when did i get this suit joe oh about the year i graduated from high school i guess they all laughed at ivy no matter what he did or said they laughedin recognition of his general success mrs forrester came back fanning herself with a little sandalwood fan and when she appeared the boys rosein alarm one might have thought from the suddenness of it that much at any rate she had succeeded in teaching them are your cocktails ready ivy you will have to wait for me a moment while i put some powder on my nose if id known how hot it would be tonight im afraid i wouldnt have had a roast for you im browner than the ducks you can pour them though i wont be long she disappeared into her own room and the boys sat down with the same surprising promptness ivy peters carried the tray about and they held their glasses before them waiting for mrs forrester when she came she took niels arm and led him into the dining room did you notice she whispered to him how they hold their glasses what is it they do to a little glass to make it look so vulgar nobody could ever teach them to pick one up and drink out of it not if there were tea in it aloud she said niel will you light the candles for me and then take the head of the table please you can carve ducks not so well asas my uncle does he murmured carefully putting back a candleshade nor as mr forrester did i dont ask that nobody can carve now as men used to but you can get them apart i suppose the place at your right is for annie peters she is bringing in the dinner for me be seated gentlemen with a little mocking bow and a swinging of earrings while niel was carving the ducks annie slipped into the chair beside him her naturally red face glowing from the heat of the stove she was several years younger than her brother whom she obeyed unquestioningly in everything she had an extremely bad complexion and pale yellow hair with white lights in it exactly the colour of molasses taffy that has been pulled until it glistens during the dinner she did not once speak except to say thank you or no thank you nobody but mrs forrester talked much until the first helping of duck was consumed the boys had not yet learned to do two things at once they paused only to ask their hostess if she would care for the jelly or to answer her questions niel studied mrs forrester between the candles as she nodded encouragingly to one and another trying to draw them out laughing at roy jones heavy jokes or congratulating joe simpson upon his new dignity as a business man with a business of his own the long earrings swung beside the thin cheeks that were none the better he thought for the rouge she had put on them when she went to her room just before dinner it improved some women but not herat least not tonight when her eyes were hollow with fatigue and she looked pinched and worn as he had never seen her he sighed as he thought how much work it meant to cook a dinner like this for eight peopleand a beefsteak with potatoes would have pleased them better they didnt really like this kind of food at all why did she do it how would she feel about it tonight when she sank dead weary into bed after these stupid boys had said goodnight and their yellow shoes had carried them down the hill she was not eating anything she was using up all her vitality to electrify these heavy lads into speech niel felt that he must help her or at least try to he addressed them one after another with energy and determination he tried baseball politics scandal the corn crop they answered him with monosyllables or exclamations he soon realized that they didnt want his polite remarks they wanted more duck and to be let alone with it dinner was soon over at any rate the hostess attempts to prolong it were unavailing the salad and frozen pudding were dispatched as promptly as the roast had been the guests went into the parlour and lit cigars mrs forrester had the oldfashioned notion that men should be alone after dinner she did not join them for half an hour perhaps she had lain down upstairs for she looked a little rested the boys were talking now discussing a camping trip ed elliott was going to take in the mountains they were giving him advice about camp outfits trout flies mixtures to keep off mosquitoes ill tell you boys said mrs forrester when she had listened to them for a moment when i go back to california i intend to have a summer cabin up in the sierras and i invite you one and all to visit me youll have to work for your keep you understand cut the firewood and bring the water and wash the pots and pans and go out and catch fish for breakfast ivy can bring his gun and shoot game for us and ill bake bread in an iron pot the old trappers way if i havent forgotten how will you come you bet we will you know those mountains by heart i expect said ed elliott she smiled and shook her head it would take a lifetime to do that ed more than a lifetime the sierrastheres no end to them and theyre magnificent niel turned to her have you ever told the boys how it was you first met captain forrester in the mountains out there if they havent heard the story i think they would like it really would you well once upon a time when i was a very young girl i was spending the summer at a camp in the mountains with friends of my fathers she began there but that was not the beginning of the story long ago niel had heard from his uncle that the beginning was a scandal and a murder when marian ormsby was nineteen she was engaged to ned montgomery a gaudy young millionaire of the gold coast a few weeks before the date set for their marriage montgomery was shot and killed in the lobby of a san francisco hotel by the husband of another woman the subsequent trial involved a great deal of publicity and marian was hurried away from curious eyes and sent up into the mountains until the affair should blow over tonight mrs forrester began with once upon a time sitting at one end of the big sofa her slippers on a footstool and her head in shadow she stirred the air before her face with the sandalwood fan as she talked the rings glittering on her white fingers she told them how captain forrester then a widower had come up to the camp to visit her fathers partner she had noticed him very littleshe was off every day with the young men one afternoon she had persuaded young fred harney an intrepid mountain climber to take her down the face of eagle cliff they were almost down and were creeping over a projecting ledge when the rope broke and they dropped to the bottom harney fell on the rocks and was killed instantly the girl was caught in a pine tree which arrested her fall both her legs were broken and she lay in the canyon all night in the bitter cold swept by the icy canyon draught nobody at the camp knew where to look for the two missing members of the partythey had stolen off alone for their foolhardy adventure nobody worried because harney knew all the trails and could not get lost in the morning however when they were still missing search parties went out it was captain forresters party that found marian and got her out by the lower trail the trail was so steep and narrow the turns round the jutting ledges so sharp that it was impossible to take her out on a litter the men took turns carrying her hugging the canyon walls with their shoulders as they crept along with her broken legs hanging she suffered terriblyfainted again and again but she noticed that she suffered less when captain forrester carried her and that he took all the most dangerous places on the trail himself i could feel his heart pump and his muscles strain she said when he balanced himself and me on the rocks i knew that if we fell wed go together he would never drop me they got back to camp and everything possible was done for her but by the time a surgeon could be got up from san francisco her fractures had begun to knit and had to be broken over again it was captain forrester i wanted to hold my hand when the surgeon had to do things to me you remember niel he always boasted that i never screamed when they were carrying me up the trail he stayed at the camp until i could begin to walk holding to his arm when he asked me to marry him he didnt have to ask twice do you wonder she looked with a smile about the circle and drew her fingertips absently across her forehead as if to brush away somethingthe past or the present who could tell the boys were genuinely moved while she was answering their questions niel thought about the first time he ever heard her tell that story mr dalzell had stopped off with a party of friends from chicago marshall field and the president of the union pacific were among them he remembered and they were going through in mr dalzells private car to hunt in the black hills she had after all not changed so much since then niel felt tonight that the right man could save her even now she was still her indomitable self going through her old partbut only the stagehands were left to listen to her all those who had shared in fine undertakings and bright occasions were gone nine with the summer months judge pommeroys health improved and as soon as he was able to be back in his office niel began to plan to return to boston he would get there the first of august and would go to work with a tutor to make up for the months he had lost it was a melancholy time for him he was in a fever of impatience to be gone and yet he felt that he was going away forever and was making the final break with everything that had been dear to him in his boyhood the people the very country itself were changing so fast that there would be nothing to come back to he had seen the end of an era the sunset of the pioneer he had come upon it when already its glory was nearly spent so in the buffalo times a traveller used to come upon the embers of a hunters fire on the prairie after the hunter was up and gone the coals would be trampled out but the ground was warm and the flattened grass where he had slept and where his pony had grazed told the story this was the very end of the roadmaking west the men who had put plains and mountains under the iron harness were old some were poor and even the successful ones were hunting for rest and a brief reprieve from death it was already gone that age nothing could ever bring it back the taste and smell and song of it the visions those men had seen in the air and followedthese he had caught in a kind of afterglow in their own facesand this would always be his it was what he most held against mrs forrester that she was not willing to immolate herself like the widow of all these great men and die with the pioneer period to which she belonged that she preferred life on any terms in the end niel went away without bidding her goodbye he went away with weary contempt for her in his heart it happened like thishad scarcely the dignity of an episode it was nothing and yet it was everything going over to see her one summer evening he stopped a moment by the diningroom window to look at the honeysuckle the diningroom door was open into the kitchen and there mrs forrester stood at a table making pastry ivy peters came in at the kitchen door walked up behind her and unconcernedly put both arms around her his hands meeting over her breast she did not move did not look up but went on rolling out pastry niel went down the hill for the last time he said as he crossed the bridge in the evening light for the last time and it was even so he never went up the poplarbordered road again he had given her a year of his life and she had thrown it away he had helped the captain to die peacefully he believed and now it was the captain who seemed the reality all those years he had thought it was mrs forrester who made that house so different from any other but ever since the captains death it was a house where old friends like his uncle were betrayed and cast off where common fellows behaved after their kind and knew a common woman when they saw her if he had not had the nature of a spaniel he told himself he would never have gone back after the first time it took two doses to cure him well he had had them nothing she could ever do would in the least matter to him again he had news of her now and then as long as his uncle lived mrs forresters name is everywhere coupled with ivy peters the judge wrote she does not look happy and i fear her health is failing but she has put herself in such a position that her husbands friends cannot help her and again of mrs forrester no news is good news she is sadly broken after his uncles death niel heard that ivy peters had at last bought the forrester place and had brought a wife from wyoming to live there mrs forrester had gone westpeople supposed to california it was years before niel could think of her without chagrin but eventually after she had drifted out of his ken when he did not know if daniel forresters widow were living or dead daniel forresters wife returned to him a bright impersonal memory he came to be very glad that he had known her and that she had had a hand in breaking him in to life he has known pretty women and clever ones since thenbut never one like her as she was in her best days her eyes when they laughed for a moment into ones own seemed to promise a wild delight that he has not found in life i know where it is they seemed to say i could show you he would like to call up the shade of the young mrs forrester as the witch of endor called up samuels and challenge it demand the secret of that ardour ask her whether she had really found some everblooming everburning everpiercing joy or whether it was all fine playacting probably she had found no more than another but she had always the power of suggesting things much lovelier than herself as the perfume of a single flower may call up the whole sweetness of spring niel was destined to hear once again of his longlost lady one evening as he was going into the diningroom of a chicago hotel a broadshouldered man with an open sunbrowned face approached him and introduced himself as one of the boys who had grown up in sweet water im ed elliott and i thought it must be you could we take a table together i promised an old friend of yours to give you a message if i ever ran across you you remember mrs forrester well i saw her again twelve years after she left sweet water down in buenos ayres they sat down and ordered dinner yes i was in south america on business im a mining engineer i spent some time in buenos ayres one evening there was a banquet of some sort at one of the big hotels and i happened to step out of the bar just as a car drove up to the entrance where the guests were going in i paid no attention until one of the ladies laughed i recognized her by her laughthat hadnt changed a particle she was all done up in furs with a scarf over her head but i saw her eyes and then i was sure i stepped up and spoke to her she seemed glad to see me made me go into the hotel and talked to me until her husband came to drag her away to the dinner oh yes she was married againto a rich cranky old englishman henry collins was his name he was born down there she told me but she met him in california she told me they lived on a big stock ranch and had come down in their car for this banquet i made inquiries afterward and found the old fellow was quite a character had been married twice before once to a brazilian woman people said he was rich but quarrelsome and rather stingy she seemed to have everything though they travelled in a fine french car and she had brought her maid along and he had his valet no she hadnt changed as much as youd think she was a good deal made up of course like most of the women down there plenty of powder and a little red too i guess her hair was black blacker than i remembered it looked as if she dyed it she invited me to visit them on their estate and so did the old man when he came to get her she asked about everybody and said if you ever meet niel herbert give him my love and tell him i often think of him she said again tell him things have turned out well for me mr collins is the kindest of husbands i called at your office in new york on my way back from south america but you were somewhere in europe it was remarkable how shed come up again she seemed pretty well gone to pieces before she left sweet water do you suppose said niel that she could be living still id almost make the trip to see her no she died about three years ago i know that for certain after she left sweet water wherever she was she always sent a cheque to the grand army post every year to have flowers put on captain forresters grave for decoration day three years ago the post got a letter from the old englishman with a draft for the future care of captain forresters grave in memory of my late wife marian forrester collins so we may feel sure that she was well cared for to the very end said niel thank god for that i knew youd feel that way said ed elliott as a warm wave of feeling passed over his face i did
