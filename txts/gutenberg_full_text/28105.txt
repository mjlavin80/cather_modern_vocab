INTRODUCTION


_A Learned Dissertation on Dumpling_ and its _Key_ (_Pudding and
Dumpling Burnt to Pot_) are typical satiric pamphlets which grew out of
the political in-fighting of the first half of the eighteenth century.
The pamphlets are distinguished by the fact that the author's level of
imagination and writing makes them delightful reading even today. In
_Dumpling_ the author displays a considerable knowledge of cooks and
cookery in London; by insinuating that to love dumpling is to love
corruption, he effectively and amusingly achieves satiric indirection
against a number of political and social targets, including Walpole. The
_Key_ is in many ways a separate pamphlet in which Swift is the central
figure under attack after his two secret visits to Walpole during 1726.
_Dumpling_ had a long life for an eighteenth-century pamphlet and was
published as late as 1770. Dr. F. T. Wood has even suggested that it may
have influenced Lamb's _Dissertation on Roast Pig_;[1] readers might
wish to test this for themselves.

_Dumpling_ and its _Key_ were first claimed for Henry Carey by Dr. Wood
(pp. 442-447). Carey (1687-1743) is generally thought to have been an
illegitimate scion of the powerful Savile family,[2] with whose name he
christened three of his sons. He was perhaps best known as a writer of
songs. "Sally in our Alley" is a classic, and he has even a tenuous
claim to the authorship of the English national anthem. Carey's
_Dramatic Works_ appeared in 1743, the year in which he met his death,
almost certainly by his own hand. Several of the plays were successful
and particular reference should be made to the burlesques
_Chrononhotonthologos_ (1734) and _The Dragon of Wantley_ (1737). The
latter even outran the performances of _The Beggar's Opera_ in its first
year. Not only do these plays show Carey's satiric bent, but so also do
a considerable number of his poems. In 1713, 1720, and 1729 Carey
published three different collections of his poetry, each entitled
_Poems on Several Occasions_. Although a few of the poems were repeated,
almost always revised, each edition is very much a different collection.
An edition was brought out in this century by Dr. Wood.[3]

I am strongly inclined to support Carey's claim to the authorship of
_Dumpling_ and its _Key_ despite Dr. E. L. Oldfield's more recent
attempt to invalidate it.[4] There were at least ten editions of
_Dumpling_ in the eighteenth century. The first seven (1726-27) appeared
during Carey's life, and these (I have seen all but the third) contain
the _Namby Pamby_ verses which later appeared under Carey's own name in
his enlarged _Poems on Several Occasions_ (1729). There was also a
"sixth edition" of _Dumpling_ (really the eighth extant edition) in
Carey's own name published "for T. Read, in Dogwell-Court, White-Friars,
Fleet-Street, MDCCXLIV." Though _Namby Pamby_ was not added to the first
edition of the _Key_, it appears in the second edition. Both editions
were published by Mrs. Dodd, of whom Dr. Oldfield says: she "seems to
have been a neighbour, and known to Carey" (p. 375). Dr. Wood indicates
that "at the foot of a folio sheet containing Carey's song _Mocking is
Catching_, published in 1726, the sixth edition of _A Learned
Dissertation on Dumpling_ is advertised as having been lately published"
(p. 442). Dr. Wood adds in a footnote that this song "appeared in _The
Musical Century_ (1740) under the title _A Sorrowful Lamentation for the
Loss of a Man and No Man_." Even more striking would seem to be the fact
that although there are ninety-one entries in his _Poems_ (1729), Carey
has placed the _Sorrowful Lamentation_ directly adjacent to _Namby
Pamby_.

Dr. Wood maintains of _Dumpling_ that "the general style bears a close
resemblance to that of the prefaces to Carey's plays and collections
of poetry" (p. 443). I should like strongly to support his statement.
Dr. Oldfield says that an inviolable regard for decency "is nowhere
contradicted in Carey's works . . . . Yet the pamphlets, besides being
palpably Whiggish, are larded _passim_ with vulgarity of the
'Close-Stool' and 'Clyster' variety" (p. 376). The reader need look no
further than _Namby Pamby_ to see that Carey satisfies Northrop Frye's
very proper observation: "Genius seems to have led practically every
great satirist to become what the world calls obscene."

As for the pamphlets being "palpably Whiggish," the reader will not look
far into the allegory before he realizes that one of the central attacks
is against those well-known Whigs Walpole and Marlborough and their
appetite for Dumpling (i.e., bribery and perquisites). Furthermore, the
attack on Swift, which is central to the _Key_, is based on the very
real fear that the Dean's two recent private interviews with Walpole
might presage a return to that leader's Whig party in exchange for
Dumpling. The last pages of the _Key_ (pp. 28-30) deal with the
possibility of an accommodation between Swift and Walpole which is,
I feel sure, the main target of attack. In his poems (_Poems_, ed. Wood,
pp. 83, 86, 88, and _passim_) Carey claims to stand between Whig and
Tory, just as he does in the pamphlets (_Dumpling_, p. 1, and _Key_,
p. 15 and _passim_).

Dr. Wood perceptively points to two parallels between _Dumpling_ and the
satiric _Of Stage Tyrants_ (1735) which Carey openly addressed to the
Earl of Chesterfield. _Dumpling's_ "O Braund, my Patron! my Pleasure!
my Pride" (p. [ii]) becomes: "O Chesterfield, my patron and my pride"
(_Poems_, ed. Wood, p. 104). The passage which follows, dealing with
"all the Monkey-Tricks of Rival Harlequins" (_Dumpling_, p. [ii]),
becomes:

  Prefer pure nature and the simple scene
  To all the monkey tricks of Harlequin

      (_Poems_, ed. Wood, p. 106).

Even more striking is a passage in the _Key_: "Mr. B[ooth] had spoken to
Mr. W[ilks] to speak to Mr. C[ibber] . . ." (p. 111). This is similar to
the following lines in _Stage Tyrants_:

  Booth ever shew'd me friendship and respect,
  And Wilks would rather forward than reject.
  Ev'n Cibber, terror to the scribbling crew,
  Would oft solicit me for something new

      (_Poems_, ed. Wood, p. 104).

What is particularly impressive is that Carey not only refers to the
three managers of Drury Lane but mentions them in the same order and as
bearing the same relationship to himself. Several highly topical
theatrical allusions in the pamphlets, by which the works can be dated,
accord closely to the life, views, and writings of Carey. All three
managers of Drury Lane were subscribers to Carey's _Poems on Several
Occasions_ (1729), which was dedicated to the Countess of Burlington,
who (like the Earl of Chesterfield) was closely related to Carey's
putative family. In the _Poems_ these people and many others (including
Pope) would have seen _Namby Pamby_ under Carey's name and drawn the
obvious conclusion that _Namby Pamby_, _Dumpling_ and the _Key_ were by
the same author.

We have already seen how closely _Dumpling_ and _Stage Tyrants_ can be
tied together; the reader can compare for himself that part of _Namby
Pamby_ containing "So the Nurses get by Heart / Namby Pamby's Little
Rhymes," with the passage from the _Key_: "It was here the D[ean] . . .
got together all his Namby Pamby . . . from the old Nurses thereabouts"
(_Key_, pp. 16-17).

There exists in the Bodleian an early copy of _Namby Pamby_ (1725?) "By
Capt. Gordon, Author of the Apology for Parson Alberony and the
Humorist." The joke here is surely in not only letting the Whig Gordon
attack the Whig Ambrose Phillips but then, also by association,
connecting Gordon's name with the attack on Walpole and Marlborough.
There is a parallel to this: Carey's "Lilliputian Ode on Their Majesties
Succession" appeared in _Poems_ (1729), separated from the pieces
previously mentioned by only one short patriotic stanza. Yet in the
Huntington Library there is an almost identical version (1727) which was
ostensibly published by Swift.

The first six editions of _Dumpling_ appeared in 1726 and both editions
of the _Key_ are dated 1727. Apart from the dates on the title page,
this can be verified externally by the initial entries in Wilford's
_Monthly Catalogue_ (1723-30) of February 1726 and April 1727
respectively. Swift's first return visit to England (in March 1726 after
twelve years) was subsequent to the publication of _Dumpling_; his
second visit was in the same month as the publication of the _Key_,
which assigns him _ex post facto_ the authorship "from Page 1. to Page
25." of _Dumpling_ (_Key_, p. ix).

Sir John Pudding and his Dumpling are manipulated throughout these
pamphlets to carry a multiplicity of meaning which brings them almost as
close to symbolism as they are to the allegory that Carey claims to be
writing (_Key_, pp. 18, 24 and 29). Collation of _Dumpling_ with its
_Key_ clearly reveals (with due allowance for satiric arabesque)
a series of allegories moving backwards and forwards through history. At
various stages, Sir John Pudding (ostensibly Brawn [or John Brand], the
famous cook of the Rummer in Queen Street who appears in Dr. King's _Art
of Cookery_ [1708]), becomes identifiable with King John, Sir John
Falstaff, Walpole, Marlborough, and even Queen Anne (for the change in
sexes see _Key_, p. 18). All of these enjoyed Dumpling, and their tastes
are ostensibly approved while at the same time being heavily undercut
with satiric indirection. Naturally enough, Walpole (although a Dumpling
Eater) is treated with considerable circumspection. Carey has warned us
that he is a bad chronologist (_Key_, p. 21), and the Sir John Pudding
(be he Walpole or Marlborough [d. 1722]), who at the end of _Dumpling_
is referred to as "the Hero of this DUMPLEID," is for good reason spoken
of in the past tense.

The fable of Dumpling, in the true spirit of _lanx satura_, allows Carey
to attack by indirection a complete spectrum of traditional
eighteenth-century targets. Like the musician and the satirist that he
is, he builds up to a magnificent crescendo (pp. 19-24 of his
"Dumpleid") which results in one of the finest displays of sustained
virtuosity in early eighteenth-century pamphlet writing.

The notes which follow the texts point to a number of the contemporary
allusions, but the reader will surely wish to recognize some of the
references and the more delicate ironies for himself. As the author puts
it on page 17 of _Dumpling_:

O wou'd to Heav'n this little Attempt of Mine may stir up some
_Pudding-headed Antiquary_ to dig his Way through all the mouldy Records
of Antiquity, and bring to Light the Noble Actions of Sir _John_!

  TO
  Mr. BRAUND.


SIR,

Let Mercenary _Authors_ flatter the Great, and subject
their Principle to Interest and Ambition, I scorn such
sordid Views; You only are Eminent in my Eyes: On You
I look as the most Useful Member in a Body-Politic,
and your Art far superior to all others: Therefore,

  _Tu mihi Mecaenas Eris!_

O BRAUND, my Patron! my Pleasure! my Pride! disdain
not to grace my Labours with a kind Perusal. Suspend
a-while your more momentous Cares, and condescend to
taste this little _Fricassee_ of Mine.

I write not this, to Bite you by the Ear, (_i.e._)
flatter you out of a Brace or two of Guinea's: No;
as I am a true _Dumpling Eater_, my Views are purely
_Epicurean_, and my utmost Hopes center'd in partaking
of some elegant _Quelque Chose_ tost up by your
judicious Hand. I regard Money but as a Ticket which
admits me to your Delicate Entertainments; to me much
more Agreeable than all the Monkey-Tricks of Rival
_Harlequins_, or _Puppet-Show_ Finery of Contending
_Theatres_.

The Plague and fatigue of Dependance and Attendance,
which call me so often to the Court-end of the Town,
were insupportable, but for the Relief I find at
AUSTIN's, your Ingenious and Grateful Disciple, who
has adorn'd _New Bond-street_ with your Graceful
_Effigies_. Nor can he fail of Custom who has hung out
a Sign so Alluring to all true _Dumpling-Eaters_. Many
a time and oft have I gaz'd with Pleasure on your
Features, and trac'd in them the exact Lineaments of
your glorious Ancestor Sir JOHN BRAND, vulgarly call'd
Sir JOHN PUDDING.

Tho' the Corruption of our _English_ Orthography
indulges some appearance of Distinction between BRAND
and BRAUND, yet in Effect they are one and the same
thing. The ancient Manor of BRAND's, alias BRAUND's,
near Kilburn in _Middlesex_, was the very Manor-House
of Sir JOHN BRAND, and is call'd BRAND's to this Day,
altho' at present it be in the Possession of the
Family of MARSH.

What Honours are therefore due to One who is in a
Direct Male Line, an Immediate Descendant from the
Loins of that Great Man! Let this teach You to value
your Self; this remind the World, how much they owe to
the Family of the BRAUNDS; more particularly to YOU,
who inherit not only the Name, but the Virtues of your
Illustrious Ancestor. I am,

  SIR,

  With all imaginable
    Esteem and Gratitude,
      Your very most
        Obedient Servant, _&c._

    A

  Learned Dissertation

    on

  DUMPLING;

  Its Dignity, Antiquity, _&c._


The Dumpling-Eaters are a Race sprung partly from the
old _Epicurean_, and partly from the _Peripatetic
Sect_; they were brought first into _Britain_ by
_Julius Cesar_; and finding it a Land of Plenty, they
wisely resolv'd never to go Home again. Their
Doctrines are Amphibious, and compos'd _Party per
Pale_ of the two Sects before-mention'd; from the
_Peripatetics_, they derive their Principle of
Walking, as a proper Method to digest a Meal, or
create an Appetite; from the _Epicureans_, they
maintain that all Pleasures are comprehended in good
Eating and Drinking: And so readily were their
Opinions embrac'd, that every Day produc'd many
Proselytes; and their Numbers have from Age to Age
increas'd prodigiously, insomuch that our whole Island
is over-run with them, at present. Eating and Drinking
are become so Customary among us that we seem to have
entirely forgot, and laid aside the old Fashion of
Fasting: Instead of having Wine sold at Apothecaries
Shops, as formerly, every Street has two or three
Taverns in it, least these Dumpling-Eaters should
faint by the Way; nay, so zealous are they in the
Cause of _Bacchus_, that one of the Chief among 'em
has made a Vow never to say his Prayers 'till he has a
Tavern of _his own_ in every Street in _London_, and
in every Market-Town in _England_. What may we then in
Time expect? Since by insensible Degrees, their
Society is become so numerous and formidable, that
they are without Number; other Bodies have their
Meetings, but where can the Dumpling-Eaters assemble?
what Place large enough to contain 'em! The _Bank_,
_India_, and _South-Sea_ Companies have their General
Courts, the _Free-Masons_ and the _Gormogons_ their
Chapters; nay, our Friends the _Quakers_ have their
Yearly Meetings. And who would imagine any of these
should be Dumpling-Eaters? But thus it is, the
Dumpling-Eating Doctrine has so far prevailed among
'em, that they eat not only Dumplings, but _Puddings_,
and those in no small Quantities.

The Dumpling is indeed, of more antient Institution,
and of _Foreign_ Origin; but alas, what were those
Dumplings? nothing but a few Lentils sodden together,
moisten'd and cemented with a little seeth'd Fat, not
much unlike our Gritt or Oatmeal Pudding; yet were
they of such Esteem among the ancient _Romans_, that a
Statue was erected to _Fulvius Agricola_, the first
Inventor of these Lentil Dumplings. How unlike the
Gratitude shewn by the Publick to our Modern
Projectors!

The _Romans_, tho' our Conquerors, found themselves
much out-done in Dumplings by our Fore-fathers; the
_Roman_ Dumplings were no more to compare to those
made by the _Britons_, than a Stone-Dumpling is to a
Marrow Pudding; tho' indeed, the _British_ Dumpling at
that time, was little better than what we call a
Stone-Dumpling, being no thing else but Flour and
Water: But every Generation growing wiser and wiser,
the Project was improv'd, and Dumpling grew to be
Pudding: One Projector found Milk better than Water;
another introduc'd Butter; some added Marrow, others
Plumbs; and some found out the Use of Sugar; so that,
to speak Truth, we know not where to fix the Genealogy
or Chronology of any of these Pudding Projectors,
to the Reproach of our Historians, who eat so much
Pudding, yet have been so Ungrateful to the first
Professors of this most noble Science, as not to find
'em a Place in History.

The Invention of Eggs was merely accidental, two or
three of which having casually roll'd from off a Shelf
into a Pudding which a good Wife was making, she found
herself under a Necessity either of throwing away her
Pudding, or letting the Eggs remain, but concluding
from the innocent Quality of the Eggs, that they would
do no Hurt, if they did no Good. She wisely jumbl'd
'em all together, after having carefully pick'd out
the Shells; the Consequence is easily imagined, the
Pudding became a Pudding of Puddings; and the Use of
Eggs from thence took its Date. The Woman was sent for
to Court to make Puddings for King _John_, who then
sway'd the Scepter; and gain'd such Favour, that she
was the making of her whole Family. I cannot conclude
this Paragraph without owning, I received this
important Part of the History of Pudding from old Mr.
_Lawrence_ of _Wilsden-Green_, the greatest Antiquary
of the present Age.

From that Time the _English_ became so famous for
Puddings, that they are call'd Pudding-Eaters all over
the World, to this Day.

At her Demise, her Son was taken into Favour, and made
the King's chief Cook; and so great was his Fame for
Puddings, that he was call'd _Jack Pudding_ all over
the Kingdom, tho' in Truth, his real Name was _John
Brand_, as by the Records of the Kitchen you will
find: This _John Brand_, or _Jack-Pudding_, call him
which you please, the _French_ have it _Jean Boudin_,
for his Fame had reached _France_, whose King would
have given the World to have had our _Jack_ for his
Pudding-Maker. This _Jack Pudding_, I say, became yet
a greater Favourite than his Mother, insomuch that he
had the King's Ear as well as his Mouth at Command;
for the King, you must know, was a mighty Lover of
Pudding; and _Jack_ fitted him to a Hair, he knew how
to make the most of a Pudding; no Pudding came amiss
to him, he would make a Pudding out of a Flint-stone,
comparatively speaking. It is needless to enumerate
the many sorts of Pudding he made, such as Plain
Pudding, Plumb Pudding, Marrow Pudding, Oatmeal
Pudding, Carrot Pudding, Saucesage Pudding, Bread
Pudding, Flower Pudding, Suet Pudding, and in short,
every Pudding but Quaking Pudding, which was solely
invented by, and took its Name from our Good Friends
of the _Bull and Mouth_ before mentioned,
notwithstanding the many Pretenders to that
Projection.

But what rais'd our Hero most in the Esteem of this
Pudding-eating Monarch, was his Second Edition of
Pudding, he being the first that ever invented the Art
of Broiling Puddings, which he did to such Perfection,
and so much to the King's likeing, (who had a mortal
Aversion to Cold Pudding,) that he thereupon
instituted him Knight of the Gridiron, and gave him a
Gridiron of Gold, the Ensign of that Order, which he
always wore as a Mark of his Sovereign's Favour; in
short, _Jack Pudding_, or Sir _John_, grew to be all
in all with good King _John_; he did nothing without
him, they were Finger and Glove; and, if we may
believe Tradition, our very good Friend had no small
Hand in the _Magna Charta_. If so, how much are all
_Englishmen_ indebted to him? in what Repute ought the
Order of the Gridiron to be, which was instituted to
do Honour to this Wonderful Man? But alas! how soon is
Merit forgot? how impudently do the Vulgar turn the
most serious Things into Ridicule, and mock the most
solemn Trophies of Honour? for now every Fool at a
Fair, or Zany at a Mountebank's Stage, is call'd _Jack
Pudding_, has a Gridiron at his Back, and a great Pair
of Spectacles at his Buttocks, to ridicule the most
noble Order of the Gridiron. But their Spectacles is a
most ungrateful Reflection on the Memory of that great
Man, whose indefatigable Application to his Business,
and deep Study in that occult Science, rendred him
Poreblind; to remedy which Misfortune, he had always a
'Squire follow'd him, bearing a huge Pair of
Spectacles to saddle his Honour's Nose, and supply his
much-lamented Defect of Sight. But whether such an
Unhappiness did not deserve rather Pity than Ridicule,
I leave to the Determination of all good Christians:
I cannot but say, it raises my Indignation, when I see
these Paunch-gutted Fellows usurping the Title and
Atchievements of my dear Sir _John_, whose Memory I so
much venerate, I cannot always contain my self.
I remember, to my Cost, I once carry'd my Resentment a
little farther than ordinary; in furiously assaulting
one of those Rascals, I tore the Gridiron from his
Back, and the Spectacles from his A--e; for which I
was Apprehended, carried to Pye-powder Court, and by
that tremendous Bench, sentenc'd to most severe Pains
and Penalties.

This has indeed a little tam'd me, insomuch that I
keep my Fingers to my self, but at the same time let
my Tongue run like a Devil: Forbear vile Miscreants,
cry I, where-e'er I meet these Wretches? forbear to
ascribe to your selves the Name and Honours of Sir
_John Pudding_? content your selves with being
_Zanies_, _Pickled-Herrings_, _Punchionellos_, but
dare not scandalize the noble Name of _Pudding_: Nor
can I, notwithstanding the Clamours and Ill Usage of
the Vulgar, refrain bearing my Testimony against this
manifest piece of Injustice.

What Pity it is therefore, so noble an Order should be
lost, or at least neglected. We have had no Account of
the real Knights of the Gridiron, since they appeared
under the fictitious Name of the _Kit-Kat Club_: In
their Possession was the very Gridiron of Gold worn by
Sir _John_ himself; which Identical Gridiron dignified
the Breast of the most ingenious Mr. _Richard
Estcourt_ that excellent Physician and Comedian, who
was President of that Noble Society.

  _Quis talia fando temperet a Lachrymis?_

What is become of the Gridiron, or of the Remains of
that excellent Body of Men, Time will, I hope,
discover. The World, I believe, must for such
Discoveries be obliged to my very good Friend _J----
T----_ Esq; who had the Honour to be Door-keeper to
that Honourable Assembly.


But to return to Sir _John_: The more his Wit engaged
the King, the more his Grandeur alarm'd his Enemies,
who encreas'd with his Honours. Not but the Courtiers
caress'd him to a Man, as the first who had brought
Dumpling-eating to Perfection. King _John_ himself
lov'd him entirely; being of _Cesar_'s Mind, that is,
he had a natural Antipathy against Meagre,
Herring-gutted Wretches; he lov'd only _Fat-headed
Men, and such who slept o' Nights_; and of such was
his whole Court compos'd. Now it was Sir _John_'s
Method, every _Sunday_ Morning, to give the Courtiers
a Breakfast, which Breakfast was every Man his
Dumpling and Cup of Wine; for you must know, he was
Yeoman of the Wine-Cellar at the same time.

This was a great Eye-sore and Heart-burning to some
Lubberly Abbots who loung'd about the Court; they took
it in great Dudgeon they were not Invited, and stuck
so close to his Skirts, that they never rested 'till
they Outed him. They told the King, who was naturally
very Hasty, that Sir _John_ made-away with his Wine,
and feasted his Paramours at his Expence; and not only
so, but that they were forming a Design against his
Life, which they in Conscience ought to discover: That
Sir _John_ was not only an Heretic, but an Heathen;
nay worse, they fear'd he was a Witch, and that he had
bewitcht His Majesty into that unaccountable Fondness
for a _Pudding-Maker_. They assur'd the King, That on
a _Sunday_ Morning, instead of being at Mattins, he
and his Trigrimates got together Hum-jum, all snug,
and perform'd many Hellish and Diabolical Ceremonies.
In short, they made the King believe that the Moon was
made of Green-Cheese: And to shew how the Innocent may
be Bely'd, and the best Intentions misrepresented,
they told the King, That He and his Associates offer'd
Sacrifices to _Ceres_: When, alas, it was only the
Dumplings they eat. The Butter which was melted and
pour'd over them, these vile Miscreants call'd
_Libations_: And the friendly Compotations of our
Dumpling-eaters, were call'd _Bacchanalian Rites_. Two
or three among 'em being sweet-tooth'd, wou'd strew a
little Sugar over their Dumplings; this was
represented as an _Heathenish Offering_. In short, not
one Action of theirs, but what these Rascally Abbots
made Criminal, and never let the King alone 'till poor
Sir _John_ was Discarded. Not but the King did it with
the greatest Reluctance; but they had made it a
Religious Concern, and he cou'd not get off on't.

But mark the Consequence: The King never enjoy'd
himself after, nor was it long before he was poison'd
by a Monk at _Swineshead_ Abbey. Then too late he saw
his Error; then he lamented the Loss of Sir _John_;
and in his latest Moments wou'd cry out, Oh! that I
had never parted from my dear _Jack Pudding_! Wou'd I
had never left off Pudding and Dumpling! I then had
never been thus basely Poison'd! never thus
treacherously sent out of the World!----Thus did this
good King lament: But, alas, to no Purpose, the Priest
had given him his Bane, and Complaints were
ineffectual.

Sir _John_, in the mean time, had retir'd into
_Norfolk_, where his diffusive Knowledge extended it
self for the Good of the County in general; and from
that very Cause _Norfolk_ has ever since been so
famous for Dumplings. He lamented the King's Death to
his very last; and was so cautious of being poison'd
by the Priests, that he never touch'd a Wafer to the
Day of his Death; And had it not been that some of the
less-designing part of the Clergy were his intimate
Friends, and eat daily of his Dumplings, he had
doubtless been Made-away with; but they stood in the
Gap for him, for the sake of his Dumplings, knowing
that when Sir _John_ was gone, they should never have
the like again.

But our facetious Knight was too free of his Talk to
be long secure; for a Hole was pick'd in his Coat in
the succeeding Reign, and poor Sir _John_ had all his
Goods and Chattels forfeited to the King's Use. It was
then time for him to bestir himself; and away to Court
he goes, to recover his Lands, _&c._ not doubting but
he had Friends there sufficient to carry his Cause.

But alas! how was he mistaken; not a Soul there knew
him; the very Porters used him rudely. In vain did he
seek for Access to the King, to vindicate his Conduct.
In vain did he claim Acquaintance with the Lords of
the Court; and reap up old Civilities, to remind 'em
of former Kindness; the Pudding was eat, the
Obligation was over: Which made Sir _John_ compose
that excellent Proverb, _Not a word of the Pudding_.
And finding all Means ineffectual, he left the Court
in a great Pet; yet not without passing a severe Joke
upon 'em, in his way, which was this; He sent a
Pudding to the King's Table, under the Name of a
_Court-Pudding_, or _Promise-Pudding_. This Pudding he
did not fail to set off with large Encomiums; assuring
the King, That therein he wou'd find an Hieroglyphical
Definition of Courtiers Promises and Friendship.

This caused some Speculation; and the King's Physician
debarr'd the King from tasting the Pudding, not
knowing but that Sir _John_ had poison'd it.

But how great a Fit of Laughter ensu'd, may be easily
guess'd, when the Pudding was cut up, it prov'd only a
large Bladder, just clos'd over with Paste: The
Bladder was full of Wind, and nothing else, excepting
these Verses written in a Roll of Paper, and put in,
as is suppos'd, before the Bladder was blown full:

  As Wynde in a Bladdere ypent,
  is Lordings promyse and ferment;
  fain what hem lust withouten drede,
  they bene so double in her falshede:
  For they in heart can think ene thing,
  and fain another in her speaking:
  and what was sweet and apparent,
  is smaterlich, and eke yshent.
  and when of service you have nede,
  pardie he will not rein nor rede.
  but when the Symnel it is eten,
  her curtesse is all foryetten.

This Adventure met with various Constructions from
those at Table: Some Laugh'd; others Frown'd. But the
King took the Joke by the right End, and Laugh'd
outright.

The Verses, tho' but scurvy ones in themselves, yet in
those Days pass'd for tolerable: Nay, the King was
mightily pleas'd with 'em, and play'd 'em off on his
Courtiers as Occasion serv'd; he wou'd stop 'em short
in the middle of a flattering Harangue, and cry, _Not
a Word of the Pudding_. This wou'd daunt and mortify
'em to the last degree; they curs'd Sir _John_ a
thousand times over for the Proverb's sake: but to no
Purpose; for the King gave him a private Hearing:
In which he so well satisfy'd His Majesty of his
Innocence and Integrity, that all his Lands were
restor'd. The King wou'd have put him in his old Post;
but he modestly declin'd it, but at the same time
presented His Majesty with a Book of most excellent
Receipts for all kinds of Puddings: Which Book His
Majesty receiv'd with all imaginable Kindness, and
kept it among his greatest Rarities.

But yet, as the best Instructions, tho' never so
strictly followed, may not be always as successfully
executed, so not one of the King's Cooks cou'd make a
Pudding like Sir _John_; nay, tho' he made a Pudding
before their Eyes, yet they out of the very same
Materials could not do the like. Which made his old
Friends the Monks attribute it to Witchcraft, and it
was currently reported the Devil was his Helper. But
good King _Harry_ was not to be fobb'd off so; the
Pudding was good, it sate very well on his Stomach,
and he eat very savourly, without the least Remorse of
Conscience.

In short, Sir _John_ grew in Favour in spite of their
Teeth: The King lov'd a merry Joke; and Sir _John_ had
always his Budget full of Punns, Connundrums and
Carrawitchets; not to forgot the Quibbles and
Fly-flaps he play'd against his Adversaries, at which
the King has laugh'd 'till his Sides crackt.

Sir _John_, tho' he was no very great Scholar, yet had
a happy way of Expressing himself: He was a Man of the
most Engaging Address, and never fail'd to draw
Attention: Plenty and Good-Nature smil'd in his Face;
his Muscles were never distorted with Anger or
Contemplation, but an eternal Smile drew up the
Corners of his Mouth; his very Eyes laugh'd; and as
for his Chin it was three-double, a-down which hung a
goodly Whey-colour'd Beard shining with the Drippings
of his Luxury; for you must know he was a great
Epicure, and had a very Sensible Mouth; he thought
nothing too-good for himself, all his Care was for his
Belly; and his Palate was so exquisite, that it was
the perfect Standard of Tasting. So that to him we owe
all that is elegant in Eating: For Pudding was not his
only Talent, he was a great Virtuoso in all manner of
Eatables; and tho' he might come short of _Lambert_
for Confectionary-Niceties, yet was he not inferiour
to _Brawnd_, _Lebec_, _Pede_, or any other great
Masters of Cookery; he could toss up a Fricassee as
well as a Pancake: And most of the Kickshaws now in
vogue, are but his Inventions, with other Names; for
what we call _Fricassees_, he call'd _Pancakes_; as,
a Pancake of Chickens, a Pancake of Rabbets, _&c._
Nay, the _French_ call a Pudding an _English_
Fricassee, to this Day.

We value our selves mightily for Roasting a Hare with
a Pudding in its Belly; when alas he has roasted an Ox
with a Pudding in his Belly. There was no Man like him
for Invention and Contrivance: And then for Execution,
he spar'd no Labour and Pains to compass his
magnanimous Designs.

O wou'd to Heav'n this little Attempt of Mine may stir
up some _Pudding-headed Antiquary_ to dig his Way
through all the mouldy Records of Antiquity, and bring
to Light the Noble Actions of Sir _John_! It will not
then be long before we see him on the Stage. Sir _John
Falstaffe_ then will be a Shrimp to Sir _John
Pudding_, when rais'd from Oblivion and reanimated by
the All-Invigorating Pen of the Well-Fed, Well-Read,
Well-Pay'd _C-- J----_ Esq; Nor wou'd this be all; for
the Pastry-Cooks wou'd from the Hands of an eminent
Physician and Poet receive whole Loads of Memorandums,
to remind 'em of the Gratitude due to Sir _John_'s
Memory.

On such a Subject I hope to see Sir _Richard_ Out-do
himself. Nor _Arthur_ nor _Eliza_ shall with Sir
_John_ compare. There is not so much difference
between a Telescope and a Powder-Puff,
a Hoop-Petty-Coat and a Farthing-Candle, a Birch-Broom
and a Diamond-Ring, as there will be between the
former Writings of this pair of Poets and their
Lucubrations on this Head.

Nor will it stop here: The _Opera_ Composers shall
have t'other Contest, which shall best sing-forth his
Praises. Sorry am I that _Nicolino_ is not here, he
would have made an excellent Sir _John_. But
_Senefino_, being blown up after the manner that
Butchers blow Calves, may do well enough. From thence
the Painters and Print-sellers shall retail his goodly
Phiz; and what _Sacheverel_ was, shall Sir _John
Pudding_ be; his Head shall hang Elate on every Sign,
his Fame shall ring in every Street, and _Cluer_'s
Press shall teem with Ballads to his Praise. This
would be but Honour, this would be but Gratitude, from
a Generation so much indebted to so Great a Man.

But how much do we deviate from Honour and Gratitude,
when we put other Names to his Inventions, and call
'em our own? What is a Tart, a Pie, or a Pasty, but
Meat or Fruit enclos'd in a Wall or Covering of
Pudding. What is a Cake, but a Bak'd Pudding; or a
_Christmas_-Pie, but a Minc'd-Meat-Pudding. As for
Cheese-cakes, Custards, Tansies, they are manifest
Puddings, and all of Sir _John_'s own Contrivance; for
Custard is as old if not older than _Magna Charta_.
In short, Pudding is of the greatest Dignity and
Antiquity. Bread it self, which is the very Staff of
Life, is, properly speaking, a Bak'd Wheat-Pudding.

To the Satchel, which is the Pudding-Bag of Ingenuity,
we are indebted for the greatest Men in Church and
State. All Arts and Sciences owe their Original to
Pudding or Dumpling. What is a Bag-Pipe, the Mother of
all Music, but a Pudding of Harmony. And what is Music
it self, but a Palatable Cookery of Sounds. To little
Puddings or Bladders of Colours we owe all the choice
Originals of the Greatest Painters: And indeed, what
is Painting, but a well-spread Pudding, or Cookery of
Colours.

The Head of Man is like a Pudding: And whence have all
Rhimes, Poems, Plots and Inventions sprang, but from
that same Pudding. What is Poetry, but a Pudding of
Words. The Physicians, tho' they cry out so much
against Cooks and Cookery, yet are but Cooks
themselves; with this difference only, the Cooks
Pudding lengthens Life, the Physicians shortens it.
So that we Live and Die by Pudding. For what is a
Clyster, but a Bag-Pudding; a Pill, but a Dumpling;
or a Bolus, but a Tansy, tho' not altogether so
Toothsome. In a word; Physick is only a Puddingizing
or Cookery of Drugs. The Law is but a Cookery of
Quibbles and Contentions. [a] * * * * * * * * * * *
  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
  * * * * * * is but a Pudding of * * * * * * * * *
  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
  * * *. Some swallow every thing whole and unmix'd;
so that it may rather be call'd a Heap, than a
Pudding. Others are so Squeamish, the greatest
Mastership in Cookery is requir'd to make the Pudding
Palatable: The Suet which others gape and swallow by
Gobs, must for these puny Stomachs be minced to Atoms;
the Plums must be pick'd with the utmost Care, and
every Ingredient proportion'd to the greatest Nicety,
or it will never go down.

    [Footnote a: _The Cat run away with this part
    of the Copy, on which the Author had unfortunately
    laid some of Mother _Crump_'s Sausages._]

The Universe it self is but a Pudding of Elements.
Empires, Kingdoms, States and Republicks are but
Puddings of People differently made up. The Celestial
and Terrestrial Orbs are decypher'd to us by a pair of
Globes or Mathematical Puddings.

The Success of War and Fate of Monarchies are entirely
dependant on Puddings and Dumplings: For what else are
Cannon-Balls, but Military Puddings; or Bullets, but
Dumplings; only with this difference, they do not sit
so well on the Stomach as a good Marrow-Pudding or
Bread-Pudding.

In short, There is nothing valuable in Nature, but
what, more or less, has an Allusion to Pudding or
Dumpling. Why then should they be held in Disesteem?
Why should Dumpling-Eating be ridicul'd, or
Dumpling-Eaters derided? Is it not Pleasant and
Profitable? Is it not Ancient and Honourable? Kings,
Princes, and Potentates have in all Ages been Lovers
of Pudding. Is it not therefore of Royal Authority?
Popes, Cardinals, Bishops, Priests and Deacons have,
Time out of Mind, been great Pudding-Eaters: Is it not
therefore a Holy and Religious Institution?
Philosophers, Poets, and Learned Men in all Faculties,
Judges, Privy-Councellors, and Members of both Houses,
have, by their great Regard to Pudding, given a
Sanction to it that nothing can efface. Is it not
therefore Ancient, Honourable, and Commendable?

  _Quare itaque fremuerunt Auctores?_

Why do therefore the Enemies of good Eating, the
Starve-gutted Authors of Grub-street, employ their
impotent Pens against Pudding and Pudding-headed,
_alias_ Honest Men? Why do they inveigh against
Dumpling-Eating which is the Life and Soul of
Good-fellowship, and Dumpling-Eaters who are the
Ornaments of Civil Society.

But, alas! their Malice is their own Punishment. The
Hireling Author of a late scandalous Libel, intituled,
_The Dumpling-Eaters Downfall_, may, if he has any
Eyes, now see his Error, in attacking so Numerous,
so August a Body of People: His Books remain Unsold,
Unread, Unregarded; while this Treatise of Mine shall
be Bought by all who love Pudding or Dumpling; to my
Bookseller's great Joy, and my no small Consolation.
How shall I Triumph, and how will that Mercenary
Scribbler be Mortify'd, when I have sold more Editions
of my Books, than he has Copies of his! I therefore
exhort all People, Gentle and Simple, Men, Women and
Children, to Buy, to Read, to Extol these Labours of
Mine, for the Honour of Dumpling-Eating. Let them not
fear to defend every Article; for I will bear them
Harmless: I have Arguments good store, and can easily
Confute, either Logically, Theologically, or
Metaphysically, all those who dare Oppose me.

Let not _Englishmen_ therefore be asham'd of the Name
of _Pudding-Eaters_; but, on the contrary, let it be
their Glory. For let Foreigners cry out ne'er so much
against Good Eating, they come easily into it when
they have been a little while in our _Land of Canaan_;
and there are very few Foreigners among as who have
not learn'd to make as great a Hole in a good Pudding
or Sirloin of Beef as the best _Englishman_ of us all.

Why shou'd we then be Laught out of Pudding and
Dumpling? or why Ridicul'd out of Good Living? Plots
and Politics may hurt us, but Pudding cannot. Let us
therefore adhere to Pudding, and keep our selves out
of Harm's Way; according to the Golden Rule laid down
by a celebrated Dumpling-Eater now defunct;

  _Be of your Patron's Mind, whate'er he says:
  Sleep very much; Think little, and Talk less:
  Mind neither Good nor Bad, nor Right nor Wrong;
  But Eat your Pudding, Fool, and Hold your Tongue._
      PRIOR.

The Author of these excellent Lines not only shews his
Wisdom, but his Good-Breeding, and great Esteem for
the Memory of Sir _John_, by giving his _Poem_ the
Title of _Merry Andrew_, and making _Merry Andrew_ the
principal Spokesman: For if I guess aright, and surely
I guess not wrong, his main Design was, to ascertain
the Name of _Merry Andrew_ to the _Fool_ of a Droll,
and to substitute it instead of _Jack Pudding_; which
Name my Friend _Matt._ cou'd not hear with Temper, as
carrying with it an oblique Reflection on Sir _John
Pudding_ the Hero of this DUMPLEID.

Let all those therefore who have any Regard to
Politeness and Propriety of Speech, take heed how they
Err against this Rule laid down by him who was the
Standard of _English_ Elegance. And be it known to all
whom it may concern, That if any Person whatever shall
dare hereafter to apply the Name of _Jack Pudding_ to
_Merry Andrews_ and such-like Creatures, I hereby
Require and Impower any Stander or Standers by, to
Knock him, her, or them down. And if any Action or
Actions of Assault and Battery shall be brought
against any Person or Persons so acting in pursuance
of this most reasonable Request, by Knocking down,
Bruising, Beating, or otherwise Demolishing such
Offenders; I will Indemnify and bear them Harmless.

  _FINIS._

  All ye Poets of the Age,
  All ye Witlings of the Stage,
  Learn your Jingles to reform;
  Crop your Numbers, and conform:
  Let your little Verses flow
  Gently, sweetly, Row by Row:
  Let the Verse the Subject fit;
  Little Subject, Little Wit:
  _Namby Pamby_ is your Guide;
  _Albion_'s Joy, _Hibernia_'s Pride.
  _Namby Pamby Pilli-pis_,
  Rhimy pim'd on Missy-Miss;
  _Tartaretta Tartaree_
  From the Navel to the Knee;
  That her Father's Gracy-Grace
  Might give him a Placy-Place.
  He no longer writes of Mammy
  _Andromache_ and her Lammy
  Hanging panging at the Breast
  Of a Matron most distrest.
  Now the Venal Poet sings
  Baby Clouts, and Baby Things,
  Baby Dolls, and Baby Houses,
  Little Misses, Little Spouses;
  Little Play-Things, Little Toys,
  Little Girls, and Little Boys:
  As an Actor does his Part,
  So the Nurses get by Heart
  _Namby Pamby_'s Little Rhimes,
  Little Jingle, Little Chimes,
  To repeat to Little Miss,
  Piddling Ponds of Pissy-Piss;
  Cacking packing like a Lady,
  Or Bye-bying in the Crady.
  _Namby Pamby_ ne'er will die
  While the Nurse sings _Lullabye_.
  _Namby Pamby_'s doubly Mild,
  Once a Man, and twice a Child;
  To his Hanging-Sleeves restor'd;
  Now he foots it like a Lord;
  Now he Pumps his little Wits;       }
  Sh--ing Writes, and Writing Sh--s,  }
  All by little tiny Bits.            }
  Now methinks I hear him say,        }
  _Boys and Girls, Come out to Play,  }
  Moon do's shine as bright as Day._  }
  Now my _Namby Pamby_'s found
  Sitting on the _Friar's Ground_,
  _Picking Silver, picking Gold_,
  _Namby Pamby_'s never Old.
  _Bally-Cally_ they begin,
  _Namby Pamby_ still keeps-in.
  _Namby Pamby_ is no Clown,
  _London-Bridge is broken down_:
  Now he _courts the gay Ladee,
  Dancing o'er the Lady-Lee_:
  Now he sings of _Lick-spit Liar
  Burning in the Brimstone Fire;
  Lyar, Lyar, Lick-spit, lick,
  Turn about the Candle-stick_:
  Now he sings of _Jacky Horner_
  _Sitting in the Chimney corner,
  Eating of a Christmas-Pie,
  Putting in his Thumb, _Oh, fie!_
  Putting in, _Oh, fie!_ his Thumb,
  Pulling out, _Oh, strange!_ a Plum._
  And again, how _Nancy Cock_,
  Nasty Girl! _besh-t her Smock_.
  Now he acts the _Grenadier_,
  Calling for _a Pot of Beer_:
  _Where's his Money? He's forgot;
  Get him gone, a Drunken Sot._
  Now on _Cock-horse_ does he ride;
  And anon on Timber stride.
  _See-and-Saw and Sacch'ry down,
  London is a gallant Town._
  Now he gathers Riches in
  Thicker, faster, Pin by Pin;
  _Pins a-piece to see his Show_;
  Boys and Girls flock Row by Row;
  From their Cloaths the Pins they take,
  Risque a Whipping for his sake;
  From their Frocks the Pins they pull,
  To fill _Namby_'s Cushion full.
  So much Wit at such an Age,
  Does a Genius great presage.
  Second Childhood gone and past,
  Shou'd he prove a Man at last,
  What must Second Manhood be,
  In a Child so Bright as he!

    Guard him, ye Poetic Powers;
  Watch his Minutes, watch his Hours:
  Let your Tuneful _Nine_ Inspire him;
  Let Poetic Fury fire him:
  Let the Poets one and all
  To his Genius Victims fall.

PREFACE


It very much surprizes me that six Editions of a
Mythological Pamphlet, entituled, _A Dissertation on
Dumpling_, should escape your Notice of that wonderful
Unriddler of Mysteries the ingenious Mr. _E---- C---_
who has at the same Time given such Proofs of his
Abilities in his many and most elaborate Keys to
_Gulliver_'s Travels; Keys, which _Gulliver_ himself
could never have found out! and withal, so pertinent,
that I shall esteem those at the Helm, no great Lovers
of Learning, if my Friend _Edmund_ be not forthwith
promoted: for as the Sweetness of a Kernel is
uncomatable, but by the Fracture of its Shell, so is
the Beauty of a Mystery altogether hid, till the
Expounder has riddlemayreed the Propounder's Problem,
and render'd it obvious to the meanest Capacity.

The only Plea I can use in Mr. _C----'s_ behalf, is,
that the Author of the Dissertation has been a little
too free with his Character, which probably occasioned
that Sullenness in our _British Oedipus_; who in Order
to be revenged, has determined not to embelish the
Work with his Interpretation, but rather let it rot
and perish in Oblivion.

This, and nothing else, could be the Reason of so
profound a Silence in so great a Mysterymonger,
to remedy which Loss to the Publick, I an unworthy
Scribler, and faint Copier of that great Artist,
presume with aching Heart, and trembling Hand, to draw
the Veil which shades the political Pamphlet in
Question; and show it to my loving Countrymen in
_Puris Naturalibus_.

If I succeed in this, I hope Mr. _L----t_, who all the
World knows is a rare Chap to his Authors, will
speedily employ me to unriddle, or at least make a
Plot to the _Rival Modes_, which it seems the Author
has omitted: it is true, he ought to have given it the
Bookseller with the Copy, but has not so done, which
makes me wonder he is not sued for Breach of Covenant;
but what is that to me, if I get a Job by the Bargain?
Let Booksellers beware how they buy Plays without
Plots for the future.

I narrowly miss'd solving the Problem called _Wagner_
and _Abericock_; Mr. _B----_ had spoke to Mr. _W----_
to speak to Mr. _C----_, who had just consented to
employ me, after having made me abate half my demand:
But Houses running thin, _Colley_ had undertaken the
Job himself to save Charges; intending at the same
Time, to annex a severe Criticism on _Pluto_ and
_Proserpine_.

This, gentle Reader, will, I hope, induce you to look
on me as a Writer of some Regard, and at the same
Time, to make a little Allowance for whatever Errors
my great Hurry may occasion, being obliged to write
Night and Day, Sundays and working Days, without the
least Assistance. All our Journeymen Writers being now
turned Masters, I am left to shift for my self; but am
bringing up my Wife to the Business, and doubt not but
a long War, and our mutual Industry, may rub off old
Scores, and make us begin a new Reckoning with all
Mankind; Pamphleteering having been so dead for many
Years last past, that (God forgive me!) I have been
oftentimes tempted to write Treason for mere
Sustenance.

But Thanks to better Stars and better Days, the Pen
revives, and Authors flourish; more Money can be made
now of a Play, nay, though it be a scurvy One, than
_Dryden_ got by all his Works. Therefore now or never
is the Time to strike while the Iron is hot, to write
my self out of Debt, and into Place, and then grow
idle and laugh at the World, as my Betters have done
before me.

INTRODUCTION.


When a Book has met with Success, it never wants a
Father; there being those good natured Souls in the
World, who, rather than let Mankind think such
Productions sprang of themselves, will own the
Vagabond Brat, and thereby become Fathers of other
Mens Offsprings.

This was the Fate of Dumpling, whose real Father did
not take more Care to conceal himself, than some did
to be thought its Author; but if any one will
recollect the Time of its Publication, they will find
it within a Week after the Arrival of D----n _S----t_,
from _Ireland_; the Occasion, as I am very well
informed, was this, the D----n, one of the first
Things he did, went to pay a Visit to Mr. _T----_, his
old Bookseller; but, to his Surprize, found both the
Brothers dead, and a Relation in the Shop, to whom he
was an utter Stranger. Mr. _M----_ for such is this
Person's Name, gathering from the D--n's Enquiries who
he was, paid him his _Devoirs_ in the most respectful
Manner, solicited his Friendship, and invited him to a
Dinner, which the D----n was pleased to accept. By the
Way, you must know, he is a great Lover of Dumpling,
as well as the Bookseller, who had ordered one for
himself, little dreaming of such a Guest that Day. The
Dinner, as 'twas not provided on purpose, was but a
Family one, well enough however for a Bookseller; that
is to say, a couple of Fowls, Bacon and Sprouts
boiled, and a Forequarter of Lamb roasted. After the
usual Complements for the unexpected Honour, and the
old Apology of wishing it was better for his sake:
The Maid, silly Girl! came and asked her Master if he
pleased to have his Dumpling; he would have chid her,
but the D----n mollified him, insisting at the same
Time, upon the Introduction of Dumpling, which
accordingly was done. Dumpling gave Cause of
Conversation, but not till it was eat; for the Reader
must understand, that both the Gentlemen play a good
Knife and Fork, and are too mannerly to talk with
their Mouths full. The Dumpling eat, as I said before,
the D----n drank to the Bookseller, the Bookseller to
the Author, and with an obsequious Smile, seem'd to
say ah! Dear Doctor, you have been a Friend to my
Predecessor, can you do nothing for me? The D--n took
the Hint, and after a profound Contemplation, cry'd,
Why ay--Dumpling will do--put me in Mind of Dumpling
anon, but not a Word more at present, and good Reason
why, Dinner was coming in. So they past the rest of
the Meal with great Silence and Application, and no
doubt dined well. Far otherwise was it with me that
Day: I remember to my Sorrow, I had a Hogs Maw,
without Salt or Mustard; having at that Time, Credit
with the Pork-Woman, but not with the Chandler: Times
are since mended, _Amen_ to the Continuance!

The D----n, having eat and drank plentifully, began
his usual Pleasantries, and made the Bookseller
measure his Ears with his Mouth; nay, burst his Sides
with Laughter; however, he found Interval enough to
remind the D----n of Dumpling, who asked him if he had
a quick Hand at Writing: he excused himself, being
naturally as Lazy as the other was Indolent, so they
contrived to ease themselves by sending for a Hackney
Writer out of _Temple Lane_ to be the D--'s
_Amanuensis_, while he and his new Acquaintance
crack'd t'other Bottle.

This Account may be depended upon, because I had it
from the Man himself, who scorns to tell a Lye.

To be short, my Friend had the worst of it, being kept
to hard Writing, without Drinking (Churls that they
were) about three Hours; in which Time the
Dissertation was finished, that is to say, from Page
1. to Page 25. the rest might probably be done at some
other leisure Time, to fill up the Chinks, but of that
he knows nothing; sufficient is it that the D----n was
the Author. Proceed we now to the other Discoveries,
by drawing the Veil from before the Book it self.

                       A
                    K  E  Y

                    to the
                  DISSERTATION

                      on
                  _DUMPLING_.


I Shall begin with his Motto, which says, _What is
better than a Pudding?_ The Body owns its Power, the
Mind, its Delicacy; it will give Youth to grey Hairs,
and Life to the most Desponding: Therefore are Pudding
Eaters of great Use in State Affairs.

This Quotation is of a Piece with his Motto to the
Tale of a Tub, and other Writings; altogether
Fictitious and Drole: he adds to the Jest, by putting
an Air of Authority or genuine Quotation from some
great Author; when alas! the whole is mere Farce and
Invention.

The Dedication is one continued Sneer upon Authors,
and their Patrons, and seems to carry a Glance of
Derision towards Men of Quality in General; by setting
a Cook above them, as a more useful Member in a body
Politick. Some will have this _Braund_, to be Sir
****, others Sir ****, others Sir ****; but I take it
to be more Railery than Mystery, and that Mr.
_Braund_, at the _Rummer_ in _Queen-street_, is the
Person; who having pleas'd the Author in two or three
Entertainments, he, with a View truly _Epicurean_,
constitutes him his _Maecenas_; as being more agreeable
to him than a whole Circle of Stars and Garters, of
what Colour or Denomination soever.

In his Tale of a Tub, he has a fling at Dependance,
and Attendance, where he talks of a Body worn out with
Poxes ill cured, and Shooes with Dependance, and
Attendance. Not having the Book by me, I am forced to
quote at Random, but I hope the courteous Reader will
bear me out. He complains of it again in this
Treatise, and makes a Complement to Mr. _Austin_, Mr.
_Braund_'s late Servant; who keeps the _Braund_'s Head
in _New Bond-street_, near _Hanover-Square_; a House
of great Elegance, and where he used frequently to
dine.

The Distinction of _Brand_, _Braund_, and _Barnes_, is
a Banter on Criticks, and Genealogists, who make such
a Pother about the Orthography of Names and Things,
that many Times, three Parts in four of a Folio
Treatise, is taken up in ascertaining the Propriety of
a Syllable, by which Means the Reader is left
undetermined; having nothing but the various Readings
on a single Word, and that probably, of small
Importance.

I heartily wish some of these Glossographists would
oblige the World with a Folio Treatise or two, on the
Word Rabbet: We shall then know whether it is to be
spelt with an _e_, or an _i_. For, to the Shame of the
_English_ Tongue and this learned Age, our most
eminent Physicians, Surgeons, Anatomists and Men
Midwives, have all been to seek in this Affair.

  St. _Andre_,    }
  _Howard_,       } Spell it
  _Braithwaite_,  } with
  _Ahlers_ and    } an _e_.
  _Manningham_,   }

  _Douglas_       }
   and the        } Spell it
   Gentleman who  } with
   calls himself  } an _i_.
  _Gulliver_,     }

And some of these great Wits, have such short
Memories, that they spell it both Ways in one and the
same Page.

The Master-Key to this Mystery, is the Explanation of
its Terms; for Example, by _Dumpling_ is meant a
Place, or any other Reward or Encouragement.
A _Pudding_ signifies a P----t, and sometimes a
C----tee. A _Dumpling Eater_, is a Dependant on the
Court, or, in a Word, any one who will rather pocket
an Affront than be angry at a Tip in Time. A _Cook_ is
a Minister of State. The _Epicurean_ and _Peripatetic_
Sects, are the two Parties of _Whigg_ and _Tory_, who
both are greedy enough of Dumpling.

The Author cannot forbear his old Sneer upon
Foreigners, but says, in his 1st Page, "That finding
it a Land of Plenty, they wisely resolved never to go
home again," and in his 2d, "Nay, so zealous are they
in the Cause of _Bacchus_, that one of the Chief among
them, made a Vow never to say his Prayers till he has
a Tavern of his own in every Street in _London_, and
in every Market-Town in _England_:" If he does not
mean Sir J---- T---- I know not who he means.

By the Invention of _Eggs_, Page 4. is meant
Perquisites. "He cannot conclude a Paragraph in his
5th _Page_, without owning he received that important
Part of the History of Pudding, from old Mr.
_Lawrence_ of _Wilsden Green_, the greatest Antiquary
of the present Age."

This old _Lawrence_ is a great Favourite of the D--s;
he is a facetious farmer, of above eighty Years of
Age, now living at _Wilsden Green_, near _Kilburn_ in
_Middlesex_, the most rural Place I ever saw: exactly
like the Wilds of _Ireland_. It was here the
D--n often retired _incog._ to amuse himself with the
Simplicity of the Place and People; where he got
together all that Rigmayroll of Childrens talk, which
composes his _Namby Pamby_. Old _Lawrence_ told me,
the D--n has sate several Hours together to see the
Children play, with the greatest Pleasure in Life: The
rest he learned from the old Nurses thereabouts, of
which there are a great many, with whom he would go
and smoke a Pipe frequently, and cordially; not in
his Clergyman's Habit, but in a black Suit of Cloth
Clothes, and without a Rose in his Hat: Which made
them conclude him to be a Presbyterian Parson.

This Mention of old _Lawrence_, is in Ridicule to a
certain great Artist, who wrote a Treatise upon the
Word _Connoisseur_ (or a Knower) and confesses himself
to have been many Years at a loss for a Word to
express the Action of Knowing, till the great Mr.
_Prior_ gave him Ease, by furnishing him with the Word
_Connoissance_. Our D--n had drawn a Drole, Parallel
to this, _viz._ _Boudineur_, a Pudding Pyeman; and
_Boudinance_, the making of Pudding Pies: But several
Men of Quality begging it off, it was, at their
Request, scratch'd out, but my Friend, the
_Amanuensis_, remembers particularly its being
originally inserted.

If the Reader should ask, Who is that K-- _John_
mentioned in the fourth Page, and which I ought to
have taken in its Place. I beg leave to inform him,
that by K. _John_ is meant the late Q. ----, with whom
the D-- of _M----_ was many Years in such great
Favour, that he was nick named K. _John_; it was in
that Part of the Q--'s Reign, that Sir _John_ Pudding,
by whom is meant **** _you know who_, came in Favour;
it is true, the Name is odd, and seems to carry an Air
of Ridicule with it, but the Character given him by
this allegorical Writer, is that of an able Statesman,
and an honest Man.

And here, begging Mr. D--n's Pardon, I cannot but
think his Wit has out run his Judgment; for he puts
the Cart before the Horse, and begins at the latter
Part of Sir **** Administration: But this might be
owing to too plentiful a Dinner, and too much of the
Creature. Be that as it will, I must follow my Copy,
and explain it as it lies. Proceed we therefore to the
Dissertation, _Page 6._

"But what rais'd our Hero most in the Esteem of this
Pudding-eating Monarch, was his second Edition of
Pudding, he being the first that ever invented the Art
of broiling Puddings, which he did to such Perfection,
and so much to the King's liking (who had a mortal
Aversion to cold Pudding) that he thereupon instituted
him Knight of the Gridiron, and gave him a Gridiron of
Gold, the Ensign of that Order; which he always wore
as a Mark of his Sovereign's Favour."

If this does not mean the late Revival of an ancient
Order of Knighthood, I never will unriddle Mystery
more: To prove which, we need but cross over to the
next Page, where he tells us, "Sir _John_ had always a
Squire, who followed him, bearing a huge Pair of
Spectacles to saddle his Honour's Nose." _Diss.
Page 7._

After this, he very severely runs upon those would-be
Statesmen, who put themselves in Competition with his
Favourite, Sir ****, with whom he became exceeding
intimate, and almost inseperable, all the Time he was
in _England_.

The Story of the Kit Cat Club, _Dick Estcourt_, and
_Jacob Tonson_, is a mere Digression; and nothing more
to the Purpose, than that we may imagine it came
uppermost. He returns to his Subject in his 9th
_Page_.

"Now it was Sir _John_'s Method, every _Sunday_
Morning, to give the Courtiers a Breakfast; which
Breakfast was every Man his Dumpling, and Cup of Wine:
For you must know, he was Yeoman of the Wine-Cellar at
the same Time."

The Breakfast is Sir *** Levee, the Yeomanship of the
Wine-Cellar, is the ***.

The Author of the Dissertation, is a very bad
Chronologist; for at _Page_ 10. we are obliged to go
back to the former Reign, where we shall find the
lubberly Abbots (_i.e._) the High Church Priests,
misrepresenting Sir _John_'s Actions, and never let
the Q---- alone, till poor Sir _John_ was discarded.

"This was a great Eye-sore, and Heart-burning to some
lubberly Abbots, who lounged about the Court; they
took it in great Dudgeon they were not invited, and
stuck so close to his Skirts, that they never rested
till they outed him. They told the King, who was
naturally very hasty, that Sir _John_, made-away with
his Wine, and feasted his _Paramours_ at his Expence;
and not only so, but they were forming a Design
against his Life, which they in Conscience ought to
discover: That Sir _John_ was not only an Heretic, but
an Heathen; nay, worse, they fear'd he was a Witch,
and that he had bewitch'd his Majesty into that
unaccountable Fondness for a _Pudding-Maker_. They
assured the King, that on a _Sunday_ Morning, instead
of being at Mattins, he and his Trigrimates got
together hum jum, all snug, and perform'd many hellish
and diabolical Ceremonies. In short, they made the
King believe that the Moon was made of Green-Cheese:
And to shew how the Innocent may be bely'd, and the
best Intentions misrepresented, they told the King,
That he and his Associates offered Sacrifices to
_Ceres_: When, alas, it was only the Dumplings they
eat.

"The Butter which was melted and poured over them,
these vile Miscreants, called _Libations_: And the
friendly Compotations of our Dumpling Eaters, were
called _Bacchanalian Rites_. Two or three among them
being sweet tooth'd, would strew a little Sugar over
their Dumplings; this was represented as an
_Heathenish Offering_. In short, not one Action of
theirs, but which these rascally Abbots made criminal,
and never let the King alone till Sir _John_ was
discarded; not but the King did it with the greatest
Reluctance; but they made it a religious Concern, and
he could not get off on't." _Diss. pag._ 10.

All the World knows that the _Tory_ Ministry got
uppermost, for the four last Years of the Queen's
Reign, and by their unaccountable Management, teaz'd
that good Lady out of her Life: Which occasion'd the
D--n in his eleventh Page to say; "Then too late he
saw his Error; then he lamented the Loss of Sir
_John_; and in his latest Moments, would cry out, Oh!
that I had never parted from my dear _Jack-Pudding_!
Would I had never left off Pudding and Dumpling! then
I had never been thus basely poison'd! never thus
treacherously sent out of the World!----Thus did this
good King lament: But alas! to no purpose, the Priest
had given him his Bane, and Complaints were
ineffectual."

This alludes to Sir **** Imprisonment and Disgrace in
the Year ---- Nay, so barefaced is the D--n in his
Allegory, that he tells us, in his 12th Page,
_Norfolk_ was his Asylum. This is as plain as the Nose
on a Man's Face! The subsequent Pages are an exact
Description of the Ingratitude of Courtiers; and his
Fable of the _Court Pudding_, Page 13. is the best
Part of the whole Dissertation.

One would imagine the D--n had been at Sea, by his
writing Catharping-Fashion, and dodging the Story
sometimes Twenty-Years backwards, at other Times
advancing as many; so that one knows not where to have
him: for in his fifteenth Page, he returns to the
present Scene of Action, and brings his Hero into the
Favour of K---- _Harry_, _alias_ **** who being
sensible of his Abilities, restores him into Favour,
and makes Use of his admirable Skill in Cookery,
_alias_ State Affairs.

"Not one of the King's Cooks could make a Pudding like
Sir _John_; nay, though he made a Pudding before their
Eyes, yet they, out of the very same Materials, could
not do the like: Which made his old Friends, the
Monks, attribute it to Witchcraft and it was currently
reported the Devil was his Helper. But good King
_Harry_ was not to be fobb'd off so; the Pudding was
good, it sat very well on his Stomach, and he eat very
savourly, without the least Remorse of Conscience."
_Diss. Page_ 15.

This seems to hint at the Opposition Sir **** met with
from the contrary Party, and how sensible the K----
was, that they were all unable to hold the Staff in
Competition with him.

After this the D--n runs into a whimsical Description
of his Heroes personal Virtues; but draws the Picture
too much _Alla Carraccatura_, and is, in my Opinion,
not only a little too familiar, but wide of his
Subject. For begging his Deanship's Pardon, he
mightily betrays his Judgment, when he says, Sir
_John_ was no very great Scholar, whereas all Men of
Learning allow him to be a most excellent one; but as
we may suppose he grew pretty warm by this Time with
the Booksellers Wine, he got into his old Knack of
Raillery, and begins to run upon all Mankind: In this
Mood he falls upon _C---- J----n_, and Sir _R----
Bl----re_, a pair of twin Poets, who suck'd one and
the same Muse. After this he has a Fling at _Handel_,
_Bononcini_ and _Attilio_, the Opera Composers; and a
severe Sneer on the late High-Church Idol,
_Sacheverel_. As for _Cluer_, the Printer, any Body
that knows Music, or _Bow Church Yard_, needs no
farther Information.

And now he proceeds to a Digression, which is indeed
the Dissertation it self; proving all Arts and
Sciences to owe their Origin and Existence to
_Pudding_ and _Dumpling_ (_i.e._) Encouragement. His
_Hiatus_ in the 20th Page, I could, but dare not
Decypher.

In his 22nd Page, he lashes the Authors who oppose the
Government; such as the _Craftsman_, _Occasional
Writer_, and other Scribblers, past, present, and to
come. _The Dumpling-Eaters Downfal_, is a Title of his
own Imagination; I have run over all _Wilford_'s
Catalogues, and see no Mention made of such a Book:
All that Paragraph therefore is a mere Piece of
Rablaiscism.

In his 23d Page, he has another confounded Fling at
Foreigners; and after having determinately dubb'd his
Hero, the Prince of Statesmen, he concludes his
Dissertation with a Mess of Drollery, and goes off in
a Laugh.

In a Word, the whole Dissertation seems calculated to
ingratiate the D--n in Sir **** Favour; he draws the
Picture of an able and an honest Minister, painful in
his Countries Service, and beloved by his Prince; yet
oftentimes misrepresented and bely'd: Nay, sometimes
on the Brink of Ruin, but always Conqueror. The Fears,
the Jealousies, the Misrepresentations of an enraged
and disappointed Party, give him no small Uneasiness
to see the Ingratitude of some Men, the Folly of
others, who shall believe black to be white, because
prejudiced and designing Knaves alarm 'em with false
Fears. We see every Action misconstrued, and Evil made
out of Good; but as the best Persons and Things are
subject to Scandal and Ridicule; so have they the
Pleasure of Triumphing in the Truth, which always will
prevail.

I take the Allegory of this Dissertation to be partly
Historical, partly Prophetical; the D--n seeming to
have carried his View, not only to the present, but
even, succeeding Times. He sets his Hero down at last
in Peace, Plenty, and a happy Retirement, not
unrelented by his Prince; his Honesty apparent, his
Enemies baffled and confounded, and his Measures made
the Standard of good Government; and a Pattern for all
just Ministers to follow.

Thus, gentle Reader, have I, at the Expence of these
poor Brains, crack'd this thick Shell, and given thee
the Kernel. If any should object, and say this
Exposition is a Contradiction to the D--n's
Principles; I assure such Objector, that the D--n is
an errant _Whig_ by Education, and Choice: He may
indeed cajole the _Tories_ with a Belief that he is of
their Party; but it is all a Joke, he is a _Whig_, and
I know him to be so; Nay more, I can prove it, and
defy him to contradict me; did he not just after his
Arrival and Promotion in _Ireland_, writing to one of
his intimate Friends in _London_, conclude his Letter
in this Manner?

_Thus Dear **** from all that has occur'd, you must
conclude me a _Tory_ in every Thing, but my Principle,
which is yet as unmoved, as, that I am,_

  Yours, _&c._

This Letter, his Tale of a Tub, and in a Word, all his
Invectives against Enthusiasm and Priestcraft, plainly
prove him to be no _Tory_; and if his Intimacy, not
only with Sir **** himself, but most of the prime Men
in the Ministry, cannot prove him a _Whig_, I have no
more to say.

  _FINIS._

_Advertisement to the _Curious_._


The Author is Night and Day at Work (in order to get
published before the _Spaniards_ have raised the Siege
of _Gibraltar_) a Treatise, entituled, _Truth brought
to light, _or_ D--n _S----t_'s _Wilsden_ Prophecy
unfolded_; being a full Explanation of a Prophetical
Poem, called _Namby Pamby_, which, by most People,
is taken for a Banter on an eminent Poet, now in
_Ireland_; when in Fact, it is a true Narrative of the
Siege of _Gibraltar_, the Defeat of the _Spaniards_,
and Success of the _British_ Arms. The Author doubts
not in this Attempt to give manifest Proof of his
Abilities, and make it apparent to all Mankind, that
he can see as clearly through a Milstone, as any other
Person can through the best Optic _Martial_ or
_Scarlet_ ever made; and that there is more in many
Things, not taken Notice of, than the Generality of
People are aware of.

NOTES TO _DUMPLING_


Pp. [ii].2-[iii].25. The information on Brand, Braund, and Marsh is
confirmed by records in the Willesdon Public Library and by Lyson's
_County of Middlesex_.

P.2.30-31. Carey also attacks the Freemasons and Gormogons in _Poems_,
ed. Wood, p. 118.

P.5.3. Old Mr. Lawrence is mentioned several times (see particularly
_Key_, pp. 16-17). There was a farmer Lawrence of 70 in Willesdon at the
time, but I have found no direct connection with an antiquary, with
Swift's Namby Pamby talk (see _OED_ under _Namby Pamby_) and his
_Wilsden Prophecy_; nor with Jonathan Richardson (see note to _Key_,
p. 17). On another level, the laziness attributed to Swift (_Key_,
p. viii) and the gridiron here connected with the Kit Cat club are both
commonly associated with Saint Lawrence.

P.6.11-12. "Bull and Mouth" refers to a tavern known as the Boulogne
Mouth (John Timbs, _Clubs and Club Life in London_ [London, 1872],
p. 529).

Pp.6.13-9.6. Knight of the Gridiron: Walpole was a member of the Kit
Cat club, which originally met at the pie shop of Christopher Cat in
Shire Lane. The "Second Edition" probably refers to the fact that the
Order of the Bath was reintroduced for Walpole's benefit in June 1724.
(See also _Key_, p. 19.) There is intentional confusion with Estcourt,
who as providore of the Beefsteak club wore about his neck a small
gridiron of silver and was made a Knight of Saint Lawrence. The Knights
of the Toast were an associated group. The gridiron is a symbol both of
gormandizing and of the roasting of Saint Lawrence.

P.9.9. J[acob] T[onson], the publisher, founded the Kit Cat club which
also met at Tonson's home in Barns Elms, and in Hampstead (which was
only a few miles northeast of Willesdon).

P.11.15-18. King John is reputed either to have been poisoned or to
have died from overeating at Swineshead Abbey (18-19 October 1216).

Pp.14.15-16.24. See also _Key_, pp. 25-26. King Harry, at this point,
would appear to be George I, with either Walpole or Marlborough as Sir
John Pudding. Nevertheless, there are carefully interpolated overtones
regarding Falstaff and Hal. "One knows not where to have him" (_Key_,
p. 25) is one of several apt Shakespearian allusions in the work.

Pp.17.25-18.26. In _Dumpling_, pp. 17-18, and _Key_, pp. 26-27, the
references are to the writers Sir R[ichard] B[lackmore] and C[harles]
J[ohnso]n; opera in the hands of Nicolino, Senesino, Handel, Buononcini
and Attilio; the high-church idol, Sacheverel (d. 1724); the _Craftsman_
(founded to attack Walpole) and the _Occasional Writer_ (Bolingbroke's 4
pamphlets of Jan/Feb. 1727); and finally the discredited music printer,
Cluer. Carey's relationship to opera was ambivalent, but in _Mocking is
Catching_ he strongly attacked Senesino.

P.24.5-29. Matt. Prior (d. 1721), despite his aristocratic pretensions,
had been earlier associated with the Rummer Tavern. He was a member of
the Kit Cat club until he became a Tory for Dumpling.

P.[32].28. E[dmund] C[url] of the "ADVERTISEMENT" was a publisher
notorious for stealing material. Carey complained frequently of his
writings having been "fathered" by others.


NOTES TO THE _KEY_

Title Page. "J. W.": Dr. Wood suggests this is the fictitious John
Walton of the "Proposals" at the end of _Dumpling_. My own preference is
for Dr. John Woodward, the famous antiquarian and physician. As late as
Fielding's "Dedication" to _Shamela_, Woodward was being mocked for
suggesting that the "Gluttony [which] is owing to the great
Multiplication of Pastry-Cooks in the City" has "Led to the Subversion
of Government...." (See Woodward's _The State of Physick and of
Diseases_ [London, 1718], pp. 194-196 and 200-201. Compare this with
_Dumpling_, pp. 22-23, on the _Dumpling-Eaters Downfall_, also pp. 9 and
16, and _Key_, p. 17.) Swift deals with "repletion" in _Gulliver's
Travels_ (ed. Herbert Davis [Oxford, 1941], pp. 253-254 and 262).

P.iii.1-22. L[intot] was Pope's publisher. B[ooth], W[ilks], and
C[ibber] were the managers of Drury Lane. _The London Stage, Part 2:
1700-1729_, ed. Emmett L. Avery (Carbondale, Ill., 1960), shows that
J. M. Smythe's _Rival Modes_ was first played 27 January 1727 at Drury
Lane; John Thurmond's pantomime _The Miser: Or Wagner and Abericock_ was
first played 30 December 1726 at Drury Lane; and Lun's pantomimes
_Harlequin a Sorcerer: With The Loves of Pluto and Proserpine_ and _The
Rape of Proserpine_ were first played at the Lincoln's Inn Fields
Theatre 21 January 1725 and 13 February 1727 respectively.

P.iv.16-25. The preface ends on a similar note to Carey's _Of Stage
Tyrants_ (p. 108).

P.[v].3-4. To "it never wants a Father," compare _Of Stage Tyrants_
(p. 107).

P.vi.1-9. Swift's "old Bookseller" had been T[ooke] (though there may
be overtones here regarding Tonson). His new publisher was [Benjamin]
M[otte].

Pp.viii.24-ix.14. The "Hackney Writer out of _Temple Lane_" could very
well be Carey. (See Carey's _Records of Love_ [London, 1710], pp. 175,
93, and 104.)

P.13.6-9. Carey's poem "The Plague of Dependence" cautions: "You may
dance out your shoes in attendance;/ [while you] .... wait for a court
dependence" (p. 90).

Pp.14.7-15.2. Here Carey cleverly ties in Swift's surgeon Gulliver,
through the "Pancake of Rabbets" (_Dumpling_, p. 17), with the topical
and notorious case of Mary Tofts, who in November 1726 was "delivered"
of fifteen rabbits. All the people mentioned were connected with this
case. Nathaniel St. Andre was the surgeon and anatomist to the King,
and Cyriacus Ahlers the King's private surgeon; John Howard was the
apothecary. The imposture was finally brought to light before Sir
Richard Manningham (the famous man-midwife who probably influenced
Sterne) and Dr. James Douglas. Among the many contemporary pamphlets on
this subject is one by Thomas Braithwaite.

Pp.16.14-17.13. The following is a very revealing quotation from
records in the Willesdon Public Library under F. A. Wood [not Dr. F. T.
Wood], _Willesdon_ I, 99: "These nurse children must have been sent from
workhouses round Willesdon ... the parish must have become a baby
farm.... The large number of deaths between 1702 and 1727 ought to have
caused some official enquiry, which probably did take place, as after
1727 they soon ceased altogether."

P.17.14-22. See Jonathan Richardson, _Works_, Strawberry Hill Press
(London, 1792), pp. 198-199: "...had the honour of a letter ... the term
_Connoisance_ was used.... I must not conceal the name it was Mr.
Prior." Richardson, a frequent visitor to Hampstead, painted both Prior
and Pope. His essay on "The Connoisseur" was frequently published.

P.18.6-22. See also p. 24 and _passim_. Robert Walpole was born and
died at Houghton in Norfolk; he was helped up by Marlborough but lost
power with him under the Tories. Walpole went to the Tower for five
months in 1712 before going to his home county, where Defoe calls him
"King Walpole in Norfolk."

P.24.19-20. The "Fable of the _Court Pudding_" (see also _Dumpling_,
pp. 13-14) ties together both meanings of the scatological Latin-English
pun on the title page of _Dumpling_.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
