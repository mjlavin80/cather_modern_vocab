claude wheeler opened his eyes before the sun was up and vigorously shook his younger brother who lay in the other half of the same bed ralph ralph get awake come down and help me wash the car what for why arent we going to the circus today cars all right let me alone the boy turned over and pulled the sheet up to his face to shut out the light which was beginning to come through the curtainless windows claude rose and dresseda simple operation which took very little time he crept down two flights of stairs feeling his way in the dusk his red hair standing up in peaks like a cocks comb he went through the kitchen into the adjoining washroom which held two porcelain stands with running water everybody had washed before going to bed apparently and the bowls were ringed with a dark sediment which the hard alkaline water had not dissolved shutting the door on this disorder he turned back to the kitchen took mahaileys tin basin doused his face and head in cold water and began to plaster down his wet hair old mahailey herself came in from the yard with her apron full of corncobs to start a fire in the kitchen stove she smiled at him in the foolish fond way she often had with him when they were alone what air you gittin up for aready boy you goin to the circus before breakfast dont you make no noise else youll have em all down here before i git my fire agoin all right mahailey claude caught up his cap and ran out of doors down the hillside toward the barn the sun popped up over the edge of the prairie like a broad smiling face the light poured across the closecropped august pastures and the hilly timbered windings of lovely creek a clear little stream with a sand bottom that curled and twisted playfully about through the south section of the big wheeler ranch it was a fine day to go to the circus at frankfort a fine day to do anything the sort of day that must somehow turn out well claude backed the little ford car out of its shed ran it up to the horsetank and began to throw water on the mudcrusted wheels and windshield while he was at work the two hired men dan and jerry came shambling down the hill to feed the stock jerry was grumbling and swearing about something but claude wrung out his wet rags and beyond a nod paid no attention to them somehow his father always managed to have the roughest and dirtiest hired men in the country working for him claude had a grievance against jerry just now because of his treatment of one of the horses molly was a faithful old mare the mother of many colts claude and his younger brother had learned to ride on her this man jerry taking her out to work one morning let her step on a board with a nail sticking up in it he pulled the nail out of her foot said nothing to anybody and drove her to the cultivator all day now she had been standing in her stall for weeks patiently suffering her body wretchedly thin and her leg swollen until it looked like an elephants she would have to stand there the veterinary said until her hoof came off and she grew a new one and she would always be stiff jerry had not been discharged and he exhibited the poor animal as if she were a credit to him mahailey came out on the hilltop and rang the breakfast bell after the hired men went up to the house claude slipped into the barn to see that molly had got her share of oats she was eating quietly her head hanging and her scaly deadlooking foot lifted just a little from the ground when he stroked her neck and talked to her she stopped grinding and gazed at him mournfully she knew him and wrinkled her nose and drew her upper lip back from her worn teeth to show that she liked being petted she let him touch her foot and examine her leg when claude reached the kitchen his mother was sitting at one end of the breakfast table pouring weak coffee his brother and dan and jerry were in their chairs and mahailey was baking griddle cakes at the stove a moment later mr wheeler came down the enclosed stairway and walked the length of the table to his own place he was a very large man taller and broader than any of his neighbours he seldom wore a coat in summer and his rumpled shirt bulged out carelessly over the belt of his trousers his florid face was clean shaven likely to be a trifle tobaccostained about the mouth and it was conspicuous both for goodnature and coarse humour and for an imperturbable physical composure nobody in the county had ever seen nat wheeler flustered about anything and nobody had ever heard him speak with complete seriousness he kept up his easygoing jocular affability even with his own family as soon as he was seated mr wheeler reached for the twopint sugar bowl and began to pour sugar into his coffee ralph asked him if he were going to the circus mr wheeler winked i shouldnt wonder if i happened in town sometime before the elephants get away he spoke very deliberately with a stateofmaine drawl and his voice was smooth and agreeable you boys better start in early though you can take the wagon and the mules and load in the cowhides the butcher has agreed to take them claude put down his knife cant we have the car ive washed it on purpose and what about dan and jerry they want to see the circus just as much as you do and i want the hides should go in theyre bringing a good price now i dont mind about your washing the car mud preserves the paint they say but itll be all right this time claude the hired men hawhawed and ralph giggled claudes freckled face got very red the pancake grew stiff and heavy in his mouth and was hard to swallow his father knew he hated to drive the mules to town and knew how he hated to go anywhere with dan and jerry as for the hides they were the skins of four steers that had perished in the blizzard last winter through the wanton carelessness of these same hired men and the price they would bring would not half pay for the time his father had spent in stripping and curing them they had lain in a shed loft all summer and the wagon had been to town a dozen times but today when he wanted to go to frankfort clean and carefree he must take these stinking hides and two coarsemouthed men and drive a pair of mules that always brayed and balked and behaved ridiculously in a crowd probably his father had looked out of the window and seen him washing the car and had put this up on him while he dressed it was like his fathers idea of a joke mrs wheeler looked at claude sympathetically feeling that he was disappointed perhaps she too suspected a joke she had learned that humour might wear almost any guise when claude started for the barn after breakfast she came running down the path calling to him faintlyhurrying always made her short of breath overtaking him she looked up with solicitude shading her eyes with her delicately formed hand if you want i should do up your linen coat claude i can iron it while youre hitching she said wistfully claude stood kicking at a bunch of mottled feathers that had once been a young chicken his shoulders were drawn high his mother saw and his figure suggested energy and determined selfcontrol you neednt mind mother he spoke rapidly muttering his words id better wear my old clothes if i have to take the hides theyre greasy and in the sun theyll smell worse than fertilizer the men can handle the hides i should think wouldnt you feel better in town to be dressed she was still blinking up at him dont bother about it put me out a clean coloured shirt if you want to thats all right he turned toward the barn and his mother went slowly back the path up to the house she was so plucky and so stooped his dear mother he guessed if she could stand having these men about could cook and wash for them he could drive them to town half an hour after the wagon left nat wheeler put on an alpaca coat and went off in the rattling buckboard in which though he kept two automobiles he still drove about the country he said nothing to his wife it was her business to guess whether or not he would be home for dinner she and mahailey could have a good time scrubbing and sweeping all day with no men around to bother them there were few days in the year when wheeler did not drive off somewhere to an auction sale or a political convention or a meeting of the farmers telephone directorsto see how his neighbours were getting on with their work if there was nothing else to look after he preferred his buckboard to a car because it was light went easily over heavy or rough roads and was so rickety that he never felt he must suggest his wifes accompanying him besides he could see the country better when he didnt have to keep his mind on the road he had come to this part of nebraska when the indians and the buffalo were still about remembered the grasshopper year and the big cyclone had watched the farms emerge one by one from the great rolling page where once only the wind wrote its story he had encouraged new settlers to take up homesteads urged on courtships lent young fellows the money to marry on seen families grow and prosper until he felt a little as if all this were his own enterprise the changes not only those the years made but those the seasons made were interesting to him people recognized nat wheeler and his cart a mile away he sat massive and comfortable weighing down one end of the slanting seat his driving hand lying on his knee even his german neighbours the yoeders who hated to stop work for a quarter of an hour on any account were glad to see him coming the merchants in the little towns about the county missed him if he didnt drop in once a week or so he was active in politics never ran for an office himself but often took up the cause of a friend and conducted his campaign for him the french saying joy of the street sorrow of the home was exemplified in mr wheeler though not at all in the french way his own affairs were of secondary importance to him in the early days he had homesteaded and bought and leased enough land to make him rich now he had only to rent it out to good farmers who liked to workhe didnt and of that he made no secret when he was at home he usually sat upstairs in the living room reading newspapers he subscribed for a dozen or morethe list included a weekly devoted to scandaland he was well informed about what was going on in the world he had magnificent health and illness in himself or in other people struck him as humorous to be sure he never suffered from anything more perplexing than toothache or boils or an occasional bilious attack wheeler gave liberally to churches and charities was always ready to lend money or machinery to a neighbour who was short of anything he liked to tease and shock diffident people and had an inexhaustible supply of funny stories everybody marveled that he got on so well with his oldest son bayliss wheeler not that bayliss was exactly diffident but he was a narrow gauge fellow the sort of prudent young man one wouldnt expect nat wheeler to like bayliss had a farm implement business in frankfort and though he was still under thirty he had made a very considerable financial success perhaps wheeler was proud of his sons business acumen at any rate he drove to town to see bayliss several times a week went to sales and stock exhibits with him and sat about his store for hours at a stretch joking with the farmers who came in wheeler had been a heavy drinker in his day and was still a heavy feeder bayliss was thin and dyspeptic and a virulent prohibitionist he would have liked to regulate everybodys diet by his own feeble constitution even mrs wheeler who took the men god had apportioned her for granted wondered how bayliss and his father could go off to conventions together and have a good time since their ideas of what made a good time were so different once every few years mr wheeler bought a new suit and a dozen stiff shirts and went back to maine to visit his brothers and sisters who were very quiet conventional people but he was always glad to get home to his old clothes his big farm his buckboard and bayliss mrs wheeler had come out from vermont to be principal of the high school when frankfort was a frontier town and nat wheeler was a prosperous bachelor he must have fancied her for the same reason he liked his son bayliss because she was so different there was this to be said for nat wheeler that he liked every sort of human creature he liked good people and honest people and he liked rascals and hypocrites almost to the point of loving them if he heard that a neighbour had played a sharp trick or done something particularly mean he was sure to drive over to see the man at once as if he hadnt hitherto appreciated him there was a large loafing dignity about claudes father he liked to provoke others to uncouth laughter but he never laughed immoderately himself in telling stories about him people often tried to imitate his smooth senatorial voice robust but never loud even when he was hilariously delighted by anythingas when poor mahailey undressing in the dark on a summer night sat down on the sticky flypaperhe was not boisterous he was a jolly easygoing father indeed for a boy who was not thinskinned ii claude and his mules rattled into frankfort just as the calliope went screaming down main street at the head of the circus parade getting rid of his disagreeable freight and his uncongenial companions as soon as possible he elbowed his way along the crowded sidewalk looking for some of the neighbour boys mr wheeler was standing on the farmers bank corner towering a head above the throng chaffing with a little hunchback who was setting up a shellgame to avoid his father claude turned and went in to his brothers store the two big show windows were full of country children their mothers standing behind them to watch the parade bayliss was seated in the little glass cage where he did his writing and bookkeeping he nodded at claude from his desk hello said claude bustling in as if he were in a great hurry have you seen ernest havel i thought i might find him in here bayliss swung round in his swivel chair to return a plough catalogue to the shelf what would he be in here for better look for him in the saloon nobody could put meaner insinuations into a slow dry remark than bayliss claudes cheeks flamed with anger as he turned away he noticed something unusual about his brothers face but he wasnt going to give him the satisfaction of asking him how he had got a black eye ernest havel was a bohemian and he usually drank a glass of beer when he came to town but he was sober and thoughtful beyond the wont of young men from bayliss drawl one might have supposed that the boy was a drunken loafer at that very moment claude saw his friend on the other side of the street following the wagon of trained dogs that brought up the rear of the procession he ran across through a crowd of shouting youngsters and caught ernest by the arm hello where are you off to im going to eat my lunch before showtime i left my wagon out by the pumping station on the creek what about you ive got no program can i go along ernest smiled i expect ive got enough lunch for two yes i know you always have ill join you later claude would have liked to take ernest to the hotel for dinner he had more than enough money in his pockets and his father was a rich farmer in the wheeler family a new thrasher or a new automobile was ordered without a question but it was considered extravagant to go to a hotel for dinner if his father or bayliss heard that he had been thereand bayliss heard everything they would say he was putting on airs and would get back at him he tried to excuse his cowardice to himself by saying that he was dirty and smelled of the hides but in his heart he knew that he did not ask ernest to go to the hotel with him because he had been so brought up that it would be difficult for him to do this simple thing he made some purchases at the fruit stand and the cigar counter and then hurried out along the dusty road toward the pumping station ernests wagon was standing under the shade of some willow trees on a little sandy bottom half enclosed by a loop of the creek which curved like a horseshoe claude threw himself on the sand beside the stream and wiped the dust from his hot face he felt he had now closed the door on his disagreeable morning ernest produced his lunch basket i got a couple bottles of beer cooling in the creek he said i knew you wouldnt want to go in a saloon oh forget it claude muttered ripping the cover off a jar of pickles he was nineteen years old and he was afraid to go into a saloon and his friend knew he was afraid after lunch claude took out a handful of good cigars he had bought at the drugstore ernest who couldnt afford cigars was pleased he lit one and as he smoked he kept looking at it with an air of pride and turning it around between his fingers the horses stood with their heads over the wagonbox munching their oats the stream trickled by under the willow roots with a cool persuasive sound claude and ernest lay in the shade their coats under their heads talking very little occasionally a motor dashed along the road toward town and a cloud of dust and a smell of gasoline blew in over the creek bottom but for the most part the silence of the warm lazy summer noon was undisturbed claude could usually forget his own vexations and chagrins when he was with ernest the bohemian boy was never uncertain was not pulled in two or three ways at once he was simple and direct he had a number of impersonal preoccupations was interested in politics and history and in new inventions claude felt that his friend lived in an atmosphere of mental liberty to which he himself could never hope to attain after he had talked with ernest for awhile the things that did not go right on the farm seemed less important claudes mother was almost as fond of ernest as he was himself when the two boys were going to high school ernest often came over in the evening to study with claude and while they worked at the long kitchen table mrs wheeler brought her darning and sat near them helping them with their latin and algebra even old mahailey was enlightened by their words of wisdom mrs wheeler said she would never forget the night ernest arrived from the old country his brother joe havel had gone to frankfort to meet him and was to stop on the way home and leave some groceries for the wheelers the train from the east was late it was ten oclock that night when mrs wheeler waiting in the kitchen heard havels wagon rumble across the little bridge over lovely creek she opened the outside door and presently joe came in with a bucket of salt fish in one hand and a sack of flour on his shoulder while he took the fish down to the cellar for her another figure appeared in the doorway a young boy short stooped with a flat cap on his head and a great oilcloth valise such as pedlars carry strapped to his back he had fallen asleep in the wagon and on waking and finding his brother gone he had supposed they were at home and scrambled for his pack he stood in the doorway blinking his eyes at the light looking astonished but eager to do whatever was required of him what if one of her own boys mrs wheeler thought she went up to him and put her arm around him laughing a little and saying in her quiet voice just as if he could understand her why youre only a little boy after all arent you ernest said afterwards that it was his first welcome to this country though he had travelled so far and had been pushed and hauled and shouted at for so many days he had lost count of them that night he and claude only shook hands and looked at each other suspiciously but ever since they had been good friends after their picnic the two boys went to the circus in a happy frame of mind in the animal tent they met big leonard dawson the oldest son of one of the wheelers near neighbours and the three sat together for the performance leonard said he had come to town alone in his car wouldnt claude ride out with him claude was glad enough to turn the mules over to ralph who didnt mind the hired men as much as he did leonard was a strapping brown fellow of twentyfive with big hands and big feet white teeth and flashing eyes full of energy he and his father and two brothers not only worked their own big farm but rented a quarter section from nat wheeler they were master farmers if there was a dry summer and a failure leonard only laughed and stretched his long arms and put in a bigger crop next year claude was always a little reserved with leonard he felt that the young man was rather contemptuous of the haphazard way in which things were done on the wheeler place and thought his going to college a waste of money leonard had not even gone through the frankfort high school and he was already a more successful man than claude was ever likely to be leonard did think these things but he was fond of claude all the same at sunset the car was speeding over a fine stretch of smooth road across the level country that lay between frankfort and the rougher land along lovely creek leonards attention was largely given up to admiring the faultless behaviour of his engine presently he chuckled to himself and turned to claude i wonder if youd take it all right if i told you a joke on bayliss i expect i would claudes tone was not at all eager you saw bayliss today notice anything queer about him one eye a little off colour did he tell you how he got it no i didnt ask him just as well a lot of people did ask him though and he said he was hunting around his place for something in the dark and ran into a reaper well im the reaper claude looked interested you mean to say bayliss was in a fight leonard laughed lord no dont you know bayliss i went in there to pay a bill yesterday and susie gray and another girl came in to sell tickets for the firemens dinner an advance man for this circus was hanging around and he began talking a little smartnothing rough but the way such fellows will the girls handed it back to him and sold him three tickets and shut him up i couldnt see how susie thought so quick what to say the minute the girls went out bayliss started knocking them said all the country girls were getting too fresh and knew more than they ought to about managing sporty men and right there i reached out and handed him one i hit harder than i meant to i meant to slap him not to give him a black eye but you cant always regulate things and i was hot all over i waited for him to come back at me im bigger than he is and i wanted to give him satisfaction well sir he never moved a muscle he stood there getting redder and redder and his eyes watered i dont say he cried but his eyes watered all right bayliss said i slow with your fists if thats your principle but slow with your tongue tooespecially when the parties mentioned arent present bayliss will never get over that was claudes only comment he dont have to leonard threw up his head im a good customer he can like it or lump it till the price of binding twine goes down for the next few minutes the driver was occupied with trying to get up a long rough hill on high gear sometimes he could make that hill and sometimes he couldnt and he was not able to account for the difference after he pulled the second lever with some disgust and let the car amble on as she would he noticed that his companion was disconcerted ill tell you what leonard claude spoke in a strained voice i think the fair thing for you to do is to get out here by the road and give me a chance leonard swung his steering wheel savagely to pass a wagon on the down side of the hill what the devil are you talking about boy you think youve got our measure all right but you ought to give me a chance first leonard looked down in amazement at his own big brown hands lying on the wheel you mortal fool kid what would i be telling you all this for if i didnt know you were another breed of cats i never thought you got on too well with bayliss yourself i dont but i wont have you thinking you can slap the men in my family whenever you feel like it claude knew that his explanation sounded foolish and his voice in spite of all he could do was weak and angry young leonard dawson saw he had hurt the boys feelings lord claude i know youre a fighter bayliss never was i went to school with him the ride ended amicably but claude wouldnt let leonard take him home he jumped out of the car with a curt goodnight and ran across the dusky fields toward the light that shone from the house on the hill at the little bridge over the creek he stopped to get his breath and to be sure that he was outwardly composed before he went in to see his mother ran against a reaper in the dark he muttered aloud clenching his fist listening to the deep singing of the frogs and to the distant barking of the dogs up at the house he grew calmer nevertheless he wondered why it was that one had sometimes to feel responsible for the behaviour of people whose natures were wholly antipathetic to ones own iii the circus was on saturday the next morning claude was standing at his dresser shaving his beard was already strong a shade darker than his hair and not so red as his skin his eyebrows and long lashes were a pale corncolourmade his blue eyes seem lighter than they were and he thought gave a look of shyness and weakness to the upper part of his face he was exactly the sort of looking boy he didnt want to be he especially hated his headso big that he had trouble in buying his hats and uncompromisingly square in shape a perfect blockhead his name was another source of humiliation claude it was a chump name like elmer and roy a hayseed name trying to be fine in country schools there was always a redheaded wartyhanded runnynosed little boy who was called claude his good physique he took for granted smooth muscular arms and legs and strong shoulders a farmer boy might be supposed to have unfortunately he had none of his fathers physical repose and his strength often asserted itself inharmoniously the storms that went on in his mind sometimes made him rise or sit down or lift something more violently than there was any apparent reason for his doing the household slept late on sunday morning even mahailey did not get up until seven the general signal for breakfast was the smell of doughnuts frying this morning ralph rolled out of bed at the last minute and callously put on his clean underwear without taking a bath this cost him not one regret though he took time to polish his new oxblood shoes tenderly with a pocket handkerchief he reached the table when all the others were half through breakfast and made his peace by genially asking his mother if she didnt want him to drive her to church in the car id like to go if i can get the work done in time she said doubtfully glancing at the clock cant mahailey tend to things for you this morning mrs wheeler hesitated everything but the separator she can but she cant fit all the parts together its a good deal of work you know now mother said ralph goodhumouredly as he emptied the syrup pitcher over his cakes youre prejudiced nobody ever thinks of skimming milk nowadays every uptodate farmer uses a separator mrs wheelers pale eyes twinkled mahailey and i will never be quite uptodate ralph were oldfashioned and i dont know but youd better let us be i could see the advantage of a separator if we milked halfadozen cows its a very ingenious machine but its a great deal more work to scald it and fit it together than it was to take care of the milk in the old way it wont be when you get used to it ralph assured her he was the chief mechanic of the wheeler farm and when the farm implements and the automobiles did not give him enough to do he went to town and bought machines for the house as soon as mahailey got used to a washingmachine or a churn ralph to keep up with the bristling march of invention brought home a still newer one the mechanical dishwasher she had never been able to use and patent flatirons and oilstoves drove her wild claude told his mother to go upstairs and dress he would scald the separator while ralph got the car ready he was still working at it when his brother came in from the garage to wash his hands you really oughtnt to load mother up with things like this ralph he exclaimed fretfully did you ever try washing this damned thing yourself of course i have if mrs dawson can manage it i should think mother could mrs dawson is a younger woman anyhow theres no point in trying to make machinists of mahailey and mother ralph lifted his eyebrows to excuse claudes bluntness see here he said persuasively dont you go encouraging her into thinking she cant change her ways mothers entitled to all the laboursaving devices we can get her claude rattled the thirtyodd graduated metal funnels which he was trying to fit together in their proper sequence well if this is laboursaving the younger boy giggled and ran upstairs for his panama hat he never quarrelled mrs wheeler sometimes said it was wonderful how much ralph would take from claude after ralph and his mother had gone off in the car mr wheeler drove to see his german neighbour gus yoeder who had just bought a blooded bull dan and jerry were pitching horseshoes down behind the barn claude told mahailey he was going to the cellar to put up the swinging shelf she had been wanting so that the rats couldnt get at her vegetables thank you mr claude i dont know what does make the rats so bad the cats catches one most every day too i guess they come up from the barn ive got a nice wide board down at the garage for your shelf the cellar was cemented cool and dry with deep closets for canned fruit and flour and groceries bins for coal and cobs and a darkroom full of photographers apparatus claude took his place at the carpenters bench under one of the square windows mysterious objects stood about him in the grey twilight electric batteries old bicycles and typewriters a machine for making cement fenceposts a vulcanizer a stereopticon with a broken lens the mechanical toys ralph could not operate successfully as well as those he had got tired of were stored away here if they were left in the barn mr wheeler saw them too often and sometimes when they happened to be in his way he made sarcastic comments claude had begged his mother to let him pile this lumber into a wagon and dump it into some washout hole along the creek but mrs wheeler said he must not think of such a thing it would hurt ralphs feelings nearly every time claude went into the cellar he made a desperate resolve to clear the place out some day reflecting bitterly that the money this wreckage cost would have put a boy through college decently while claude was planing off the board he meant to suspend from the joists mahailey left her work and came down to watch him she made some pretence of hunting for pickled onions then seated herself upon a cracker box close at hand there was a plush springrocker with one arm gone but it wouldnt have been her idea of good manners to sit there her eyes had a kind of sleepy contentment in them as she followed claudes motions she watched him as if he were a baby playing her hands lay comfortably in her lap mr ernest aint been over for a long time he aint mad about nothin is he oh no hes awful busy this summer i saw him in town yesterday we went to the circus together mahailey smiled and nodded thats nice im glad for you two boys to have a good time mr ernests a nice boy i always liked him first rate hes a little feller though he aint big like you is he i guess he aint as tall as mr ralph even not quite said claude between strokes hes strong though and gets through a lot of work oh i know i know he is i know he works hard all them foreigners works hard dont they mr claude i reckon he liked the circus maybe they dont have circuses like ourn over where he come from claude began to tell her about the clown elephant and the trained dogs and she sat listening to him with her pleased foolish smile there was something wise and farseeing about her smile too mahailey had come to them long ago when claude was only a few months old she had been brought west by a shiftless virginia family which went to pieces and scattered under the rigours of pioneer farmlife when the mother of the family died there was nowhere for mahailey to go and mrs wheeler took her in mahailey had no one to take care of her and mrs wheeler had no one to help her with the work it had turned out very well mahailey had had a hard life in her young days married to a savage mountaineer who often abused her and never provided for her she could remember times when she sat in the cabin beside an empty mealbarrel and a cold iron pot waiting for him to bring home a squirrel he had shot or a chicken he had stolen too often he brought nothing but a jug of mountain whiskey and a pair of brutal fists she thought herself well off now never to have to beg for food or go off into the woods to gather firing to be sure of a warm bed and shoes and decent clothes mahailey was one of eighteen children most of them grew up lawless or halfwitted and two of her brothers like her husband ended their lives in jail she had never been sent to school and could not read or write claude when he was a little boy tried to teach her to read but what she learned one night she had forgotten by the next she could count and tell the time of day by the clock and she was very proud of knowing the alphabet and of being able to spell out letters on the flour sacks and coffee packages thats a big a she would murmur and that theres a little a mahailey was shrewd in her estimate of people and claude thought her judgment sound in a good many things he knew she sensed all the shades of personal feeling the accords and antipathies in the household as keenly as he did and he would have hated to lose her good opinion she consulted him in all her little difficulties if the leg of the kitchen table got wobbly she knew he would put in new screws for her when she broke a handle off her rolling pin he put on another and he fitted a haft to her favourite butcherknife after every one else said it must be thrown away these objects after they had been mended acquired a new value in her eyes and she liked to work with them when claude helped her lift or carry anything he never avoided touching her this she felt deeply she suspected that ralph was a little ashamed of her and would prefer to have some brisk young thing about the kitchen on days like this when other people were not about mahailey liked to talk to claude about the things they did together when he was little the sundays when they used to wander along the creek hunting for wild grapes and watching the red squirrels or trailed across the high pastures to a wildplum thicket at the north end of the wheeler farm claude could remember warm spring days when the plum bushes were all in blossom and mahailey used to lie down under them and sing to herself as if the honeyheavy sweetness made her drowsy songs without words for the most part though he recalled one mountain dirge which said over and over and they laid jesse james in his grave iv the time was approaching for claude to go back to the struggling denominational college on the outskirts of the state capital where he had already spent two dreary and unprofitable winters mother he said one morning when he had an opportunity to speak to her alone i wish you would let me quit the temple and go to the state university she looked up from the mass of dough she was kneading but why claude well i could learn more for one thing the professors at the temple arent much good most of them are just preachers who couldnt make a living at preaching the look of pain that always disarmed claude came instantly into his mothers face son dont say such things i cant believe but teachers are more interested in their students when they are concerned for their spiritual development as well as the mental brother weldon said many of the professors at the state university are not christian men they even boast of it in some cases oh i guess most of them are good men all right at any rate they know their subjects these little pinheaded preachers like weldon do a lot of harm running about the country talking hes sent around to pull in students for his own school if he didnt get them hed lose his job i wish hed never got me most of the fellows who flunk out at the state come to us just as he did but how can there be any serious study where they give so much time to athletics and frivolity they pay their football coach a larger salary than their president and those fraternity houses are places where boys learn all sorts of evil ive heard that dreadful things go on in them sometimes besides it would take more money and you couldnt live as cheaply as you do at the chapins claude made no reply he stood before her frowning and pulling at a calloused spot on the inside of his palm mrs wheeler looked at him wistfully im sure you must be able to study better in a quiet serious atmosphere she said he sighed and turned away if his mother had been the least bit unctuous like brother weldon he could have told her many enlightening facts but she was so trusting and childlike so faithful by nature and so ignorant of life as he knew it that it was hopeless to argue with her he could shock her and make her fear the world even more than she did but he could never make her understand his mother was oldfashioned she thought dancing and cardplaying dangerous pastimesonly rough people did such things when she was a girl in vermontand worldliness only another word for wickedness according to her conception of education one should learn not think and above all one must not enquire the history of the human race as it lay behind one was already explained and so was its destiny which lay before the mind should remain obediently within the theological concept of history nat wheeler didnt care where his son went to school but he too took it for granted that the religious institution was cheaper than the state university and that because the students there looked shabbier they were less likely to become too knowing and to be offensively intelligent at home however he referred the matter to bayliss one day when he was in town claudes got some notion he wants to go to the state university this winter bayliss at once assumed that wise betterbepreparedfortheworst expression which had made him seem shrewd and seasoned from boyhood i dont see any point in changing unless hes got good reasons well he thinks that bunch of parsons at the temple dont make firstrate teachers i expect they can teach claude quite a bit yet if he gets in with that fast football crowd at the state therell be no holding him for some reason bayliss detested football this athletic business is a good deal overdone if claude wants exercise he might put in the fall wheat that night mr wheeler brought the subject up at supper questioned claude and tried to get at the cause of his discontent his manner was jocular as usual and claude hated any public discussion of his personal affairs he was afraid of his fathers humour when it got too near him claude might have enjoyed the large and somewhat gross cartoons with which mr wheeler enlivened daily life had they been of any other authorship but he unreasonably wanted his father to be the most dignified as he was certainly the handsomest and most intelligent man in the community moreover claude couldnt bear ridicule very well he squirmed before he was hit saw it coming invited it mr wheeler had observed this trait in him when he was a little chap called it false pride and often purposely outraged his feelings to harden him as he had hardened claudes mother who was afraid of everything but schoolbooks and prayermeetings when he first married her she was still more or less bewildered but she had long ago got over any fear of him and any dread of living with him she accepted everything about her husband as part of his rugged masculinity and of that she was proud in her quiet way claude had never quite forgiven his father for some of his practical jokes one warm spring day when he was a boisterous little boy of five playing in and out of the house he heard his mother entreating mr wheeler to go down to the orchard and pick the cherries from a tree that hung loaded claude remembered that she persisted rather complainingly saying that the cherries were too high for her to reach and that even if she had a ladder it would hurt her back mr wheeler was always annoyed if his wife referred to any physical weakness especially if she complained about her back he got up and went out after a while he returned all right now evangeline he called cheerily as he passed through the kitchen cherries wont give you any trouble you and claude can run along and pick em as easy as can be mrs wheeler trustfully put on her sunbonnet gave claude a little pail and took a big one herself and they went down the pasture hill to the orchard fenced in on the low land by the creek the ground had been ploughed that spring to make it hold moisture and claude was running happily along in one of the furrows when he looked up and beheld a sight he could never forget the beautiful roundtopped cherry tree full of green leaves and red fruithis father had sawed it through it lay on the ground beside its bleeding stump with one scream claude became a little demon he threw away his tin pail jumped about howling and kicking the loose earth with his coppertoed shoes until his mother was much more concerned for him than for the tree son son she cried its your fathers tree he has a perfect right to cut it down if he wants to hes often said the trees were too thick in here maybe it will be better for the others taint so hes a damn fool damn fool claude bellowed still hopping and kicking almost choking with rage and hate his mother dropped on her knees beside him claude stop id rather have the whole orchard cut down than hear you say such things after she got him quieted they picked the cherries and went back to the house claude had promised her that he would say nothing but his father must have noticed the little boys angry eyes fixed upon him all through dinner and his expression of scorn even then his flexible lips were only too well adapted to hold the picture of that feeling for days afterward claude went down to the orchard and watched the tree grow sicker wilt and wither away god would surely punish a man who could do that he thought a violent temper and physical restlessness were the most conspicuous things about claude when he was a little boy ralph was docile and had a precocious sagacity for keeping out of trouble quiet in manner he was fertile in devising mischief and easily persuaded his older brother who was always looking for something to do to execute his plans it was usually claude who was caught redhanded sitting mild and contemplative on his quilt on the floor ralph would whisper to claude that it might be amusing to climb up and take the clock from the shelf or to operate the sewingmachine when they were older and played out of doors he had only to insinuate that claude was afraid to make him try a frosted axe with his tongue or jump from the shed roof the usual hardships of country boyhood were not enough for claude he imposed physical tests and penances upon himself whenever he burned his finger he followed mahaileys advice and held his hand close to the stove to draw out the fire one year he went to school all winter in his jacket to make himself tough his mother would button him up in his overcoat and put his dinnerpail in his hand and start him off as soon as he got out of sight of the house he pulled off his coat rolled it under his arm and scudded along the edge of the frozen fields arriving at the frame schoolhouse panting and shivering but very well pleased with himself v claude waited for his elders to change their mind about where he should go to school but no one seemed much concerned not even his mother two years ago the young man whom mrs wheeler called brother weldon had come out from lincoln preaching in little towns and country churches and recruiting students for the institution at which he taught in the winter he had convinced mrs wheeler that his college was the safest possible place for a boy who was leaving home for the first time claudes mother was not discriminating about preachers she believed them all chosen and sanctified and was never happier than when she had one in the house to cook for and wait upon she made young mr weldon so comfortable that he remained under her roof for several weeks occupying the spare room where he spent the mornings in study and meditation he appeared regularly at mealtime to ask a blessing upon the food and to sit with devout downcast eyes while the chicken was being dismembered his topshaped head hung a little to one side the thin hair was parted precisely over his high forehead and brushed in little ripples he was soft spoken and apologetic in manner and took up as little room as possible his meekness amused mr wheeler who liked to ply him with food and never failed to ask him gravely what part of the chicken he would prefer in order to hear him murmur a little of the white meat if you please while he drew his elbows close as if he were adroitly sliding over a dangerous place in the afternoon brother weldon usually put on a fresh lawn necktie and a hard glistening straw hat which left a red streak across his forehead tucked his bible under his arm and went out to make calls if he went far ralph took him in the automobile claude disliked this young man from the moment he first met him and could scarcely answer him civilly mrs wheeler always absentminded and now absorbed in her cherishing care of the visitor did not notice claudes scornful silences until mahailey whom such things never escaped whispered to her over the stove one day mr claude he dont like the preacher he just aint got no use fur him but dont you let on as a result of brother weldons sojourn at the farm claude was sent to the temple college claude had come to believe that the things and people he most disliked were the ones that were to shape his destiny when the second week of september came round he threw a few clothes and books into his trunk and said goodbye to his mother and mahailey ralph took him into frankfort to catch the train for lincoln after settling himself in the dirty daycoach claude fell to meditating upon his prospects there was a pullman car on the train but to take a pullman for a daylight journey was one of the things a wheeler did not do claude knew that he was going back to the wrong school that he was wasting both time and money he sneered at himself for his lack of spirit if he had to do with strangers he told himself he could take up his case and fight for it he could not assert himself against his father or mother but he could be bold enough with the rest of the world yet if this were true why did he continue to live with the tiresome chapins the chapin household consisted of a brother and sister edward chapin was a man of twentysix with an old wasted faceand he was still going to school studying for the ministry his sister annabelle kept house for him that is to say she did whatever housework was done the brother supported himself and his sister by getting odd jobs from churches and religious societies he supplied the pulpit when a minister was ill did secretarial work for the college and the young mens christian association claudes weekly payment for room and board though a small sum was very necessary to their comfort chapin had been going to the temple college for four years and it would probably take him two years more to complete the course he conned his book on trolleycars or while he waited by the track on windy corners and studied far into the night his natural stupidity must have been something quite out of the ordinary after years of reverential study he could not read the greek testament without a lexicon and grammar at his elbow he gave a great deal of time to the practice of elocution and oratory at certain hours their frail domicileit had been thinly built for the academic poor and sat upon concrete blocks in lieu of a foundationreechoed with his hoarse overstrained voice declaiming his own orations or those of wendell phillips annabelle chapin was one of claudes classmates she was not as dull as her brother she could learn a conjugation and recognize the forms when she met with them again but she was a gushing silly girl who found almost everything in their grubby life too good to be true and she was unfortunately sentimental about claude annabelle chanted her lessons over and over to herself while she cooked and scrubbed she was one of those people who can make the finest things seem tame and flat merely by alluding to them last winter she had recited the odes of horace about the houseit was exactly her notion of the studentlike thing to dountil claude feared he would always associate that poet with the heaviness of hurriedly prepared luncheons mrs wheeler liked to feel that claude was assisting this worthy pair in their struggle for an education but he had long ago decided that since neither of the chapins got anything out of their efforts but a kind of messy inefficiency the struggle might better have been relinquished in the beginning he took care of his own room kept it bare and habitable free from annabelles attentions and decorations but the flimsy pretences of lighthousekeeping were very distasteful to him he was born with a love of order just as he was born with red hair it was a personal attribute the boy felt bitterly about the way in which he had been brought up and about his hair and his freckles and his awkwardness when he went to the theatre in lincoln he took a seat in the gallery because he knew that he looked like a green country boy his clothes were never right he bought collars that were too high and neckties that were too bright and hid them away in his trunk his one experiment with a tailor was unsuccessful the tailor saw at once that his stammering client didnt know what he wanted so he persuaded him that as the season was spring he needed light checked trousers and a blue serge coat and vest when claude wore his new clothes to st pauls church on sunday morning the eyes of every one he met followed his smart legs down the street for the next week he observed the legs of old men and young and decided there wasnt another pair of checked pants in lincoln he hung his new clothes up in his closet and never put them on again though annabelle chapin watched for them wistfully nevertheless claude thought he could recognize a welldressed man when he saw one he even thought he could recognize a welldressed woman if an attractive woman got into the street car when he was on his way to or from temple place he was distracted between the desire to look at her and the wish to seem indifferent claude is on his way back to lincoln with a fairly liberal allowance which does not contribute much to his comfort or pleasure he has no friends or instructors whom he can regard with admiration though the need to admire is just now uppermost in his nature he is convinced that the people who might mean something to him will always misjudge him and pass him by he is not so much afraid of loneliness as he is of accepting cheap substitutes of making excuses to himself for a teacher who flatters him of waking up some morning to find himself admiring a girl merely because she is accessible he has a dread of easy compromises and he is terribly afraid of being fooled vi three months later on a grey december day claude was seated in the passenger coach of an accommodation freight train going home for the holidays he had a pile of books on the seat beside him and was reading when the train stopped with a jerk that sent the volumes tumbling to the floor he picked them up and looked at his watch it was noon the freight would lie here for an hour or more until the eastbound passenger went by claude left the car and walked slowly up the platform toward the station a bundle of little spruce trees had been flung off near the freight office and sent a smell of christmas into the cold air a few drays stood about the horses blanketed the steam from the locomotive made a spreading deepviolet stain as it curled up against the grey sky claude went into a restaurant across the street and ordered an oyster stew the proprietress a plump little german woman with a frizzed bang always remembered him from trip to trip while he was eating his oysters she told him that she had just finished roasting a chicken with sweet potatoes and if he liked he could have the first brown cut off the breast before the trainmen came in for dinner asking her to bring it along he waited sitting on a stool his boots on the leadpipe footrest his elbows on the shiny brown counter staring at a pyramid of tough looking bunsandwiches under a glass globe i been lookin for you every day said mrs voigt when she brought his plate i put plenty good gravy on dem sweet pertaters ja thank you you must be popular with your boarders she giggled ja all de train men is friends mit me sometimes dey bring me a liddle schweizerkase from one of dem big saloons in omaha what de cherman beobles batronize i aint got no boys mein own self so i got to fix up liddle tings for dem boys eh she stood nursing her stumpy hands under her apron watching every mouthful he ate so eagerly that she might have been tasting it herself the train crew trooped in shouting to her and asking what there was for dinner and she ran about like an excited little hen chuckling and cackling claude wondered whether workingmen were as nice as that to old women the world over he didnt believe so he liked to think that such geniality was common only in what he broadly called the west he bought a big cigar and strolled up and down the platform enjoying the fresh air until the passenger whistled in after his freight train got under steam he did not open his books again but sat looking out at the grey homesteads as they unrolled before him with their stripped dry cornfields and the great ploughed stretches where the winter wheat was asleep a starry sprinkling of snow lay like hoarfrost along the crumbly ridges between the furrows claude believed he knew almost every farm between frankfort and lincoln he had made the journey so often on fast trains and slow he went home for all the holidays and had been again and again called back on various pretexts when his mother was sick when ralph overturned the car and broke his shoulder when his father was kicked by a vicious stallion it was not a wheeler custom to employ a nurse if any one in the household was ill it was understood that some member of the family would act in that capacity claude was reflecting upon the fact that he had never gone home before in such good spirits two fortunate things had happened to him since he went over this road three months ago as soon as he reached lincoln in september he had matriculated at the state university for special work in european history the year before he had heard the head of the department lecture for some charity and resolved that even if he were not allowed to change his college he would manage to study under that man the course claude selected was one upon which a student could put as much time as he chose it was based upon the reading of historical sources and the professor was notoriously greedy for full notebooks claudes were of the fullest he worked early and late at the university library often got his supper in town and went back to read until closing hour for the first time he was studying a subject which seemed to him vital which had to do with events and ideas instead of with lexicons and grammars how often he had wished for ernest during the lectures he could see ernest drinking them up agreeing or dissenting in his independent way the class was very large and the professor spoke without noteshe talked rapidly as if he were addressing his equals with none of the coaxing persuasiveness to which temple students were accustomed his lectures were condensed like a legal brief but there was a kind of dry fervour in his voice and when he occasionally interrupted his exposition with purely personal comment it seemed valuable and important claude usually came out from these lectures with the feeling that the world was full of stimulating things and that one was fortunate to be alive and to be able to find out about them his reading that autumn actually made the future look brighter to him seemed to promise him something one of his chief difficulties had always been that he could not make himself believe in the importance of making money or spending it if that were all then life was not worth the trouble the second good thing that had befallen him was that he had got to know some people he liked this came about accidentally after a football game between the temple eleven and the state university teammerely a practice game for the latter claude was playing halfback with the temple toward the close of the first quarter he followed his interference safely around the right end dodged a tackle which threatened to end the play and broke loose for a ninety yard run down the field for a touchdown he brought his eleven off with a good showing the state men congratulated him warmly and their coach went so far as to hint that if he ever wanted to make a change there would be a place for him on the university team claude had a proud moment but even while coach ballinger was talking to him the temple students rushed howling from the grandstand and annabelle chapin ridiculous in a sport suit of her own construction bedecked with the temple colours and blowing a childs horn positively threw herself upon his neck he disengaged himself not very gently and stalked grimly away to the dressing shed what was the use if you were always with the wrong crowd julius erlich who played quarter on the state team took him aside and said affably come home to supper with me tonight wheeler and meet my mother come along with us and dress in the armory you have your clothes in your suitcase havent you theyre hardly clothes to go visiting in claude replied doubtfully oh that doesnt matter were all boys at home mother wouldnt mind if you came in your track things claude consented before he had time to frighten himself by imagining difficulties the erlich boy often sat next him in the history class and they had several times talked together hitherto claude had felt that he couldnt make erlich out but this afternoon while they dressed after their shower they became good friends all in a few minutes claude was perhaps less tiedup in mind and body than usual he was so astonished at finding himself on easy confidential terms with erlich that he scarcely gave a thought to his secondday shirt and his collar with a broken edgewretched economies he had been trained to observe they had not walked more than two blocks from the armory when julius turned in at a rambling wooden house with an unfenced terraced lawn he led claude around to the wing and through a glass door into a big room that was all windows on three sides above the wainscoting the room was full of boys and young men seated on long divans or perched on the arms of easy chairs and they were all talking at once on one of the couches a young man in a smoking jacket lay reading as composedly as if he were alone five of these are my brothers said his host and the rest are friends the company recognized claude and included him in their talk about the game when the visitors had gone julius introduced his brothers they were all nice boys claude thought and had easy agreeable manners the three older ones were in business but they too had been to the game that afternoon claude had never before seen brothers who were so outspoken and frank with one another to him they were very cordial the one who was lying down came forward to shake hands keeping the place in his book with his finger on a table in the middle of the room were pipes and boxes of tobacco cigars in a glass jar and a big chinese bowl full of cigarettes this provisionment seemed the more remarkable to claude because at home he had to smoke in the cowshed the number of books astonished him almost as much the wainscoting all around the room was built up in open bookcases stuffed with volumes fat and thin and they all looked interesting and hardused one of the brothers had been to a party the night before and on coming home had put his dresstie about the neck of a little plaster bust of byron that stood on the mantel this head with the tie at a rakish angle drew claudes attention more than anything else in the room and for some reason instantly made him wish he lived there julius brought in his mother and when they went to supper claude was seated beside her at one end of the long table mrs erlich seemed to him very young to be the head of such a family her hair was still brown and she wore it drawn over her ears and twisted in two little horns like the ladies in old daguerreotypes her face too suggested a daguerreotype there was something oldfashioned and picturesque about it her skin had the soft whiteness of white flowers that have been drenched by rain she talked with quick gestures and her decided little nod was quaint and very personal her hazelcoloured eyes peered expectantly over her noseglasses always watching to see things turn out wonderfully well always looking for some good german fairy in the cupboard or the cakebox or in the steaming vapor of washday the boys were discussing an engagement that had just been announced and mrs erlich began to tell claude a long story about how this brilliant young man had come to lincoln and met this beautiful young girl who was already engaged to a cold and academic youth and how after many heartburnings the beautiful girl had broken with the wrong man and become betrothed to the right one and now they were so happy and every one she asked claude to believe was equally happy in the middle of her narrative julius reminded her smilingly that since claude didnt know these people he would hardly be interested in their romance but she merely looked at him over her noseglasses and said and is that so herr julius one could see that she was a match for them the conversation went racing from one thing to another the brothers began to argue hotly about a new girl who was visiting in town whether she was pretty how pretty she was whether she was naive to claude this was like talk in a play he had never heard a living person discussed and analysed thus before he had never heard a family talk so much or with anything like so much zest here there was none of the poisonous reticence he had always associated with family gatherings nor the awkwardness of people sitting with their hands in their lap facing each other each one guarding his secret or his suspicion while he hunted for a safe subject to talk about their fertility of phrase too astonished him how could people find so much to say about one girl to be sure a good deal of it sounded farfetched to him but he sadly admitted that in such matters he was no judge when they went back to the living room julius began to pick out airs on his guitar and the bearded brother sat down to read otto the youngest seeing a group of students passing the house ran out on to the lawn and called them intwo boys and a girl with red cheeks and a fur stole claude had made for a corner and was perfectly content to be an onlooker but mrs erlich soon came and seated herself beside him when the doors into the parlour were opened she noticed his eyes straying to an engraving of napoleon which hung over the piano and made him go and look at it she told him it was a rare engraving and she showed him a portrait of her greatgrandfather who was an officer in napoleons army to explain how this came about was a long story as she talked to claude mrs erlich discovered that his eyes were not really pale but only looked so because of his light lashes they could say a great deal when they looked squarely into hers and she liked what they said she soon found out that he was discontented how he hated the temple school and why his mother wished him to go there when the three who had been called in from the sidewalk took their leave claude rose also they were evidently familiars of the house and their careless exit with a gay goodnight everybody gave him no practical suggestion as to what he ought to say or how he was to get out julius made things more difficult by telling him to sit down as it wasnt time to go yet but mrs erlich said it was time he would have a long ride out to temple place it was really very easy she walked to the door with him and gave him his hat patting his arm in a final way you will come often to see us we are going to be friends her forehead with its neat curtains of brown hair came something below claudes chin and she peered up at him with that quaintly hopeful expression as ifas if even he might turn out wonderfully well certainly nobody had ever looked at him like that before its been lovely he murmured to her quite without embarrassment and in happy unconsciousness he turned the knob and passed out through the glass door while the freight train was puffing slowly across the winter country leaving a black trail suspended in the still air claude went over that experience minutely in his mind as if he feared to lose something of it on approaching home he could remember exactly how mrs erlich and the boys had looked to him on that first night could repeat almost word for word the conversation which had been so novel to him then he had supposed the erlichs were rich people but he found out afterwards that they were poor the father was dead and all the boys had to work even those who were still in school they merely knew how to live he discovered and spent their money on themselves instead of on machines to do the work and machines to entertain people machines claude decided could not make pleasure whatever else they could do they could not make agreeable people either in so far as he could see the latter were made by judicious indulgence in almost everything he had been taught to shun since that first visit he had gone to the erlichs not as often as he wished certainly but as often as he dared some of the university boys seemed to drop in there whenever they felt like it were almost members of the family but they were better looking than he and better company to be sure long baumgartner was an intimate of the house and he was a gawky boy with big red hands and patched shoes but he could at least speak german to the mother and he played the piano and seemed to know a great deal about music claude didnt wish to be a bore sometimes in the evening when he left the library to smoke a cigar he walked slowly past the erlichs house looking at the lighted windows of the sittingroom and wondering what was going on inside before he went there to call he racked his brain for things to talk about if there had been a football game or a good play at the theatre that helped of course almost without realizing what he was doing he tried to think things out and to justify his opinions to himself so that he would have something to say when the erlich boys questioned him he had grown up with the conviction that it was beneath his dignity to explain himself just as it was to dress carefully or to be caught taking pains about anything ernest was the only person he knew who tried to state clearly just why he believed this or that and people at home thought him very conceited and foreign it wasnt american to explain yourself you didnt have to on the farm you said you would or you wouldnt that roosevelt was all right or that he was crazy you werent supposed to say more unless you were a stump speakerif you tried to say more it was because you liked to hear yourself talk since you never said anything you didnt form the habit of thinking if you got too much bored you went to town and bought something new but all the people he met at the erlichs talked if they asked him about a play or a book and he said it was no good they at once demanded why the erlichs thought him a clam but claude sometimes thought himself amazing could it really be he who was airing his opinions in this indelicate manner he caught himself using words that had never crossed his lips before that in his mind were associated only with the printed page when he suddenly realized that he was using a word for the first time and probably mispronouncing it he would become as much confused as if he were trying to pass a lead dollar would blush and stammer and let some one finish his sentence for him claude couldnt resist occasionally dropping in at the erlichs in the afternoon then the boys were away and he could have mrs erlich to himself for halfanhour when she talked to him she taught him so much about life he loved to hear her sing sentimental german songs as she worked spinn spinn du tochter mein he didnt know why but he simply adored it every time he went away from her he felt happy and full of kindness and thought about beech woods and walled towns or about carl schurz and the romantic revolution he had been to see mrs erlich just before starting home for the holidays and found her making german christmas cakes she took him into the kitchen and explained the almost holy traditions that governed this complicated cookery her excitement and seriousness as she beat and stirred were very pretty claude thought she told off on her fingers the many ingredients but he believed there were things she did not name the fragrance of old friendships the glow of early memories belief in wonderworking rhymes and songs surely these were fine things to put into little cakes after claude left her he did something a wheeler didnt do he went down to o street and sent her a box of the reddest roses he could find in his pocket was the little note she had written to thank him vii it was beginning to grow dark when claude reached the farm while ralph stopped to put away the car he walked on alone to the house he never came back without emotiontry as he would to pass lightly over these departures and returns which were all in the days work when he came up the hill like this toward the tall house with its lighted windows something always clutched at his heart he both loved and hated to come home he was always disappointed and yet he always felt the rightness of returning to his own place even when it broke his spirit and humbled his pride he felt it was right that he should be thus humbled he didnt question that the lowest state of mind was the truest and that the less a man thought of himself the more likely he was to be correct in his estimate approaching the door claude stopped a moment and peered in at the kitchen window the table was set for supper and mahailey was at the stove stirring something in a big iron pot cornmeal mush probablyshe often made it for herself now that her teeth had begun to fail she stood leaning over embracing the pot with one arm and with the other she beat the stiff contents nodding her head in time to this rotary movement confused emotions surged up in claude he went in quickly and gave her a bearish hug her face wrinkled up in the foolish grin he knew so well lord how you scared me mr claude a little moren id a had my mush all over the floor you lookin fine you nice boy you he knew mahailey was gladder to see him come home than any one except his mother hearing mrs wheelers wandering uncertain steps in the enclosed stairway he opened the door and ran halfway up to meet her putting his arm about her with the almost painful tenderness he always felt but seldom was at liberty to show she reached up both hands and stroked his hair for a moment laughing as one does to a little boy and telling him she believed it was redder every time he came back have we got all the corn in mother no claude we havent you know were always behindhand its been fine open weather for husking too but at least weve got rid of that miserable jerry so theres something to be thankful for he had one of his fits of temper in town one day when he was hitching up to come home and leonard dawson saw him beat one of our horses with the neckyoke leonard told your father and spoke his mind and your father discharged jerry if you or ralph had told him he most likely wouldnt have done anything about it but i guess all fathers are the same she chuckled confidingly leaning on claudes arm as they descended the stairs i guess so did he hurt the horse much which one was it the little black pompey i believe he is rather a mean horse the men said one of the bones over the eye was broken but he would probably come round all right pompey isnt mean hes nervous all the horses hated jerry and they had good reason to claude jerked his shoulders to shake off disgusting recollections of this mongrel man which flashed back into his mind he had seen things happen in the barn that he positively couldnt tell his father mr wheeler came into the kitchen and stopped on his way upstairs long enough to say hello claude you look pretty well yes sir im all right thank you bayliss tells me youve been playing football a good deal not more than usual we played half a dozen games generally got licked the state has a fine team though i expect mr wheeler drawled as he strode upstairs supper went as usual dan kept grinning and blinking at claude trying to discover whether he had already been informed of jerrys fate ralph told him the neighbourhood gossip gus yoeder their german neighbour was bringing suit against a farmer who had shot his dog leonard dawson was going to marry susie grey she was the girl on whose account leonard had slapped bayliss claude remembered after supper ralph and mr wheeler went off in the car to a christmas entertainment at the country schoolhouse claude and his mother sat down for a quiet talk by the hardcoal burner in the living room upstairs claude liked this room especially when his father was not there the old carpet the faded chairs the secretary bookcase the spotty engraving with all the scenes from pilgrims progress that hung over the sofathese things made him feel at home ralph was always proposing to refurnish the room in mission oak but so far claude and his mother had saved it claude drew up his favourite chair and began to tell mrs wheeler about the erlich boys and their mother she listened but he could see that she was much more interested in hearing about the chapins and whether edwards throat had improved and where he had preached this fall that was one of the disappointing things about coming home he could never interest his mother in new things or people unless they in some way had to do with the church he knew too she was always hoping to hear that he at last felt the need of coming closer to the church she did not harass him about these things but she had told him once or twice that nothing could happen in the world which would give her so much pleasure as to see him reconciled to christ he realized as he talked to her about the erlichs that she was wondering whether they werent very worldly people and was apprehensive about their influence on him the evening was rather a failure and he went to bed early claude had gone through a painful time of doubt and fear when he thought a great deal about religion for several years from fourteen to eighteen he believed that he would be lost if he did not repent and undergo that mysterious change called conversion but there was something stubborn in him that would not let him avail himself of the pardon offered he felt condemned but he did not want to renounce a world he as yet knew nothing of he would like to go into life with all his vigour with all his faculties free he didnt want to be like the young men who said in prayermeeting that they leaned on their saviour he hated their way of meekly accepting permitted pleasures in those days claude had a sharp physical fear of death a funeral the sight of a neighbour lying rigid in his black coffin overwhelmed him with terror he used to lie awake in the dark plotting against death trying to devise some plan of escaping it angrily wishing he had never been born was there no way out of the world but this when he thought of the millions of lonely creatures rotting away under ground life seemed nothing but a trap that caught people for one horrible end there had never been a man so strong or so good that he had escaped and yet he sometimes felt sure that he claude wheeler would escape that he would actually invent some clever shift to save himself from dissolution when he found it he would tell nobody he would be crafty and secret putrefaction decay he could not give his pleasant warm body over to that filthiness what did it mean that verse in the bible he shall not suffer his holy one to see corruption if anything could cure an intelligent boy of morbid religious fears it was a denominational school like that to which claude had been sent now he dismissed all christian theology as something too full of evasions and sophistries to be reasoned about the men who made it he felt sure were like the men who taught it the noblest could be damned according to their theory while almost any meanspirited parasite could be saved by faith faith as he saw it exemplified in the faculty of the temple school was a substitute for most of the manly qualities he admired young men went into the ministry because they were timid or lazy and wanted society to take care of them because they wanted to be pampered by kind trusting women like his mother though he wanted little to do with theology and theologians claude would have said that he was a christian he believed in god and in the spirit of the four gospels and in the sermon on the mount he used to halt and stumble at blessed are the meek until one day he happened to think that this verse was meant exactly for people like mahailey and surely she was blessed viii on the sunday after christmas claude and ernest were walking along the banks of lovely creek they had been as far as mr wheelers timber claim and back it was like an autumn afternoon so warm that they left their overcoats on the limb of a crooked elm by the pasture fence the fields and the bare treetops seemed to be swimming in light a few brown leaves still clung to the bushy trees along the creek in the upper pasture more than a mile from the house the boys found a bittersweet vine that wound about a little dogwood and covered it with scarlet berries it was like finding a christmas tree growing wild out of doors they had just been talking about some of the books claude had brought home and his history course he was not able to tell ernest as much about the lectures as he had meant to and he felt that this was more ernests fault than his own ernest was such a literalminded fellow when they came upon the bittersweet they forgot their discussion and scrambled down the bank to admire the red clusters on the woody smokecoloured vine and its pale gold leaves ready to fall at a touch the vine and the little tree it honoured hidden away in the cleft of a ravine had escaped the stripping winds and the eyes of schoolchildren who sometimes took a short cut home through the pasture at its roots the creek trickled thinly along black between two jagged crusts of melting ice when they left the spot and climbed back to the level claude again felt an itching to prod ernest out of his mild and reasonable mood what are you going to do after a while ernest do you mean to farm all your life naturally if i were going to learn a trade id be at it before now what makes you ask that oh i dont know i suppose people must think about the future sometime and youre so practical the future eh ernest shut one eye and smiled thats a big word after i get a place of my own and have a good start im going home to see my old folks some winter maybe ill marry a nice girl and bring her back is that all thats enough if it turns out right isnt it perhaps it wouldnt be for me i dont believe i can ever settle down to anything dont you feel that at this rate there isnt much in it in what in living at all going on as we do what do we get out of it take a day like this you waken up in the morning and youre glad to be alive its a good enough day for anything and you feel sure something will happen well whether its a workday or a holiday its all the same in the end at night you go to bednothing has happened but what do you expect what can happen to you except in your own mind if i get through my work and get an afternoon off to see my friends like this its enough for me is it well if weve only got once to live it seems like there ought to be somethingwell something splendid about life sometimes ernest was sympathetic now he drew nearer to claude as they walked along and looked at him sidewise with concern you americans are always looking for something outside yourselves to warm you up and it is no way to do in old countries where not very much can happen to us we know thatand we learn to make the most of little things the martyrs must have found something outside themselves otherwise they could have made themselves comfortable with little things why i should say they were the ones who had nothing but their idea it would be ridiculous to get burned at the stake for the sensation sometimes i think the martyrs had a good deal of vanity to help them along too claude thought ernest had never been so tiresome he squinted at a bright object across the fields and said cuttingly the fact is ernest you think a man ought to be satisfied with his board and clothes and sundays off dont you ernest laughed rather mournfully it doesnt matter much what i think about it things are as they are nothing is going to reach down from the sky and pick a man up i guess claude muttered something to himself twisting his chin about over his collar as if he had a bridlebit in his mouth the sun had dropped low and the two boys as mrs wheeler watched them from the kitchen window seemed to be walking beside a prairie fire she smiled as she saw their black figures moving along on the crest of the hill against the golden sky even at that distance the one looked so adaptable and the other so unyielding they were arguing probably and probably claude was on the wrong side ix after the vacation claude again settled down to his reading in the university library he worked at a table next the alcove where the books on painting and sculpture were kept the art students all of whom were girls read and whispered together in this enclosure and he could enjoy their company without having to talk to them they were lively and friendly they often asked him to lift heavy books and portfolios from the shelves and greeted him gaily when he met them in the street or on the campus and talked to him with the easy cordiality usual between boys and girls in a coeducational school one of these girls miss peachy millmore was different from the othersdifferent from any girl claude had ever known she came from georgia and was spending the winter with her aunt on b street although she was short and plump miss millmore moved with what might be called a carriage and she had altogether more manner and more reserve than the western girls her hair was yellow and curlythe short ringlets about her ears were just the colour of a new chicken her vivid blue eyes were a trifle too prominent and a generous blush of colour mantled her cheeks it seemed to pulsate thereone had a desire to touch her cheeks to see if they were hot the erlich brothers and their friends called her the georgia peach she was considered very pretty and the university boys had rushed her when she first came to town since then her vogue had somewhat declined miss millmore often lingered about the campus to walk down town with claude however he tried to adapt his long stride to her tripping gait she was sure to get out of breath she was always dropping her gloves or her sketchbook or her purse and he liked to pick them up for her and to pull on her rubbers which kept slipping off at the heel she was very kind to single him out and be so gracious to him he thought she even coaxed him to pose in his track clothes for the life class on saturday morning telling him that he had a magnificent physique a compliment which covered him with confusion but he posed of course claude looked forward to seeing peachy millmore missed her if she were not in the alcove found it quite natural that she should explain her absences to himtell him how often she washed her hair and how long it was when she uncoiled it one friday in february julius erlich overtook claude on the campus and proposed that they should try the skating tomorrow yes im going out claude replied ive promised to teach miss millmore to skate wont you come along and help me julius laughed indulgently oh no some other time i dont want to break in on that nonsense you could teach her better than i oh i havent the courage what do you mean you know what i mean no i dont why do you always laugh about that girl anyhow julius made a little grimace she wrote some awfully slushy letters to phil bowen and he read them aloud at the frat house one night didnt you slap him claude demanded turning red well i would have thought i would said julius smiling but i didnt they were too silly to make a fuss about ive been wary of the georgia peach ever since if you touched that sort of peach ever so lightly it might remain in your hand i dont think so replied claude haughtily shes only kindhearted perhaps youre right but im terribly afraid of girls who are too kindhearted julius confessed he had wanted to drop claude a word of warning for some time claude kept his engagement with miss millmore he took her out to the skating pond several times indeed though in the beginning he told her he feared her ankles were too weak their last excursion was made by moonlight and after that evening claude avoided miss millmore when he could do so without being rude she was attractive to him no more it was her way to subdue by clinging contact one could scarcely call it design it was a degree less subtle than that she had already thus subdued a pale cousin in atlanta and it was on this account that she had been sent north she had claude angrily admitted no reservethough when one first met her she seemed to have so much her eager susceptibility presented not the slightest temptation to him he was a boy with strong impulses and he detested the idea of trifling with them the talk of the disreputable men his father kept about the place at home instead of corrupting him had given him a sharp disgust for sensuality he had an almost hippolytean pride in candour x the erlich family loved anniversaries birthdays occasions that spring mrs erlichs first cousin wilhelmina schroederschatz who sang with the chicago opera company came to lincoln as soloist for the may festival as the date of her engagement approached her relatives began planning to entertain her the matinee musical was to give a formal reception for the singer so the erlichs decided upon a dinner each member of the family invited one guest and they had great difficulty in deciding which of their friends would be most appreciative of the honour there were to be more men than women because mrs erlich remembered that cousin wilhelmina had never been partial to the society of her own sex one evening when her sons were revising their list mrs erlich reminded them that she had not as yet named her guest for me she said with decision you may put down claude wheeler this announcement was met with groans and laughter you dont mean it mother the oldest son protested poor old claude wouldnt know what it was all aboutand one stick can spoil a dinner party mrs erlich shook her finger at him with conviction you will see your cousin wilhelmina will be more interested in that boy than in any of the others julius thought if she were not too strongly opposed she might still yield her point for one thing mother claude hasnt any dinner clothes he murmured she nodded to him that has been attended to herr julius he is having some made when i sounded him he told me he could easily afford it the boys said if things had gone as far as that they supposed they would have to make the best of it and the eldest wrote down claude wheeler with a flourish if the erlich boys were apprehensive their anxiety was nothing to claudes he was to take mrs erlich to madame schroederschatzs recital and on the evening of the concert when he appeared at the door the boys dragged him in to look him over otto turned on all the lights and mrs erlich in her new black lace over white satin fluttered into the parlour to see what figure her escort cut claude pulled off his overcoat as he was bid and presented himself in the sooty blackness of fresh broadcloth mrs erlichs eyes swept his long black legs his smooth shoulders and lastly his square red head affectionately inclined toward her she laughed and clapped her hands now all the girls will turn round in their seats to look and wonder where i got him claude began to bestow her belongings in his overcoat pockets opera glasses in one fan in another she put a lorgnette into her little bag along with her powderbox handkerchief and smelling saltsthere was even a little silver box of peppermint drops in case she might begin to cough she drew on her long gloves arranged a lace scarf over her hair and at last was ready to have the evening cloak which claude held wound about her when she reached up and took his arm bowing to her sons they laughed and liked claude better his steady protecting air was a frame for the gay little picture she made the dinner party came off the next evening the guest of honour madame wilhelmina schroederschatz was some years younger than her cousin augusta erlich she was short stalwart with an enormous chest a fine head and a commanding presence her great contralto voice which she used without much discretion was a really superb organ and gave people a pleasure as substantial as food and drink at dinner she sat on the right of the oldest son claude beside mrs erlich at the other end of the table watched attentively the lady attired in green velvet and blazing rhinestones after dinner as madame schroederschatz swept out of the dining room she dropped her cousins arm and stopped before claude who stood at attention behind his chair if cousin augusta can spare you we must have a little talk together we have been very far separated she said she led claude to one of the window seats in the livingroom at once complained of a draft and sent him to hunt for her green scarf he brought it and carefully put it about her shoulders but after a few moments she threw it off with a slightly annoyed air as if she had never wanted it claude with solicitude reminded her about the draft draft she said lifting her chin there is no draft here she asked claude where he lived how much land his father owned what crops they raised and about their poultry and dairy when she was a child she had lived on a farm in bavaria and she seemed to know a good deal about farming and livestock she was disapproving when claude told her they rented half their land to other farmers if i were a young man i would begin to acquire land and i would not stop until i had a whole county she declared she said that when she met new people she liked to find out the way they made their living her own way was a hard one later in the evening madame schroederschatz graciously consented to sing for her cousins when she sat down to the piano she beckoned claude and asked him to turn for her he shook his head smiling ruefully im sorry im so stupid but i dont know one note from another she tapped his sleeve well never mind i may want the piano moved yet you could do that for me eh when madame schroederschatz was in mrs erlichs bedroom powdering her nose before she put on her wraps she remarked what a pity augusta that you have not a daughter now to marry to claude melnotte he would make you a perfect soninlaw ah if i only had sighed mrs erlich or continued madame schroederschatz energetically pulling on her large carriage shoes if you were but a few years younger it might not yet be too late oh dont be a fool augusta such things have happened and will happen again however better a widow than to be tied to a sick manlike a stone about my neck what a husband to go home to and i a woman in full vigour jas ist ein kreuz ich trage she smote her bosom on the left side having put on first a velvet coat then a fur mantle madame schroederschatz moved like a galleon out into the living room and kissed all her cousins and claude wheeler goodnight xi one warm afternoon in may claude sat in his upstairs room at the chapins copying his thesis which was to take the place of an examination in history it was a criticism of the testimony of jeanne darc in her nine private examinations and the trial in ordinary the professor had assigned him the subject with a flash of humour although this evidence had been pawed over by so many hands since the fifteenth century by the phlegmatic and the fiery by rhapsodists and cynics he felt sure that wheeler would not dismiss the case lightly indeed claude put a great deal of time and thought upon the matter and for the time being it seemed quite the most important thing in his life he worked from an english translation of the proces but he kept the french text at his elbow and some of her replies haunted him in the language in which they were spoken it seemed to him that they were like the speech of her saints of whom jeanne said the voice is beautiful sweet and low and it speaks in the french tongue claude flattered himself that he had kept all personal feeling out of the paper that it was a cold estimate of the girls motives and character as indicated by the consistency and inconsistency of her replies and of the change wrought in her by imprisonment and by the fear of the fire when he had copied the last page of his manuscript and sat contemplating the pile of written sheets he felt that after all his conscientious study he really knew very little more about the maid of orleans than when he first heard of her from his mother one day when he was a little boy he had been shut up in the house with a cold he remembered and he found a picture of her in armour in an old book and took it down to the kitchen where his mother was making apple pies she glanced at the picture and while she went on rolling out the dough and fitting it to the pans she told him the story he had forgotten what she saidit must have been very fragmentarybut from that time on he knew the essential facts about joan of arc and she was a living figure in his mind she seemed to him then as clear as now and now as miraculous as then it was a curious thing he reflected that a character could perpetuate itself thus by a picture a word a phrase it could renew itself in every generation and be born over and over again in the minds of children at that time he had never seen a map of france and had a very poor opinion of any place farther away than chicago yet he was perfectly prepared for the legend of joan of arc and often thought about her when he was bringing in his cobs in the evening or when he was sent to the windmill for water and stood shaking in the cold while the chilled pump brought it slowly up he pictured her then very much as he did now about her figure there gathered a luminous cloud like dust with soldiers in it the banner with lilies a great church cities with walls on this balmy spring afternoon claude felt softened and reconciled to the world like gibbon he was sorry to have finished his labourand he could not see anything else as interesting ahead he must soon be going home now there would be a few examinations to sit through at the temple a few more evenings with the erlichs trips to the library to carry back the books he had been usingand then he would suddenly find himself with nothing to do but take the train for frankfort he rose with a sigh and began to fasten his history papers between covers glancing out of the window he decided that he would walk into town and carry his thesis which was due today the weather was too fine to sit bumping in a street car the truth was he wished to prolong his relations with his manuscript as far as possible he struck off by the roadit could scarcely be called a street since it ran across raw prairie land where the buffalopeas were in blossom claude walked slower than was his custom his straw hat pushed back on his head and the blaze of the sun full in his face his body felt light in the scented wind and he listened drowsily to the larks singing on dried weeds and sunflower stalks at this season their song is almost painful to hear it is so sweet he sometimes thought of this walk long afterward it was memorable to him though he could not say why on reaching the university he went directly to the department of european history where he was to leave his thesis on a long table with a pile of others he rather dreaded this and was glad when just as he entered the professor came out from his private office and took the bound manuscript into his own hands nodding cordially your thesis oh yes jeanne darc the proces i had forgotten interesting material isnt it he opened the cover and ran over the pages i suppose you acquitted her on the evidence claude blushed yes sir well now you might read what michelet has to say about her theres an old translation in the library did you enjoy working on it i did very much claude wished to heaven he could think of something to say youve got a good deal out of your course altogether havent you ill be interested to see what you do next year your work has been very satisfactory to me the professor went back into his study and claude was pleased to see that he carried the manuscript with him and did not leave it on the table with the others xii between haying and harvest that summer ralph and mr wheeler drove to denver in the big car leaving claude and dan to cultivate the corn when they returned mr wheeler announced that he had a secret after several days of reticence during which he shut himself up in the sittingroom writing letters and passed mysterious words and winks with ralph at table he disclosed a project which swept away all claudes plans and purposes on the return trip from denver mr wheeler had made a detour down into yucca county colorado to visit an old friend who was in difficulties tom wested was a maine man from wheelers own neighbourhood several years ago he had lost his wife now his health had broken down and the denver doctors said he must retire from business and get into a low altitude he wanted to go back to maine and live among his own people but was too much discouraged and frightened about his condition even to undertake the sale of his ranch and live stock mr wheeler had been able to help his friend and at the same time did a good stroke of business for himself he owned a farm in maine his share of his fathers estate which for years he had rented for little more than the upkeep by making over this property and assuming certain mortgages he got westeds fine wellwatered ranch in exchange he paid him a good price for his cattle and promised to take the sick man back to maine and see him comfortably settled there all this mr wheeler explained to his family when he called them up to the living room one hot breathless night after supper mrs wheeler who seldom concerned herself with her husbands business affairs asked absently why they bought more land when they already had so much they could not farm half of it just like a woman evangeline just like a woman mr wheeler replied indulgently he was sitting in the full glare of the acetylene lamp his neckband open his collar and tie on the table beside him fanning himself with a palmleaf fan you might as well ask me why i want to make more money when i havent spent all ive got he intended he said to put ralph on the colorado ranch and give the boy some responsibility ralph would have the help of westeds foreman an old hand in the cattle business who had agreed to stay on under the new management mr wheeler assured his wife that he wasnt taking advantage of poor wested the timber on the maine place was really worth a good deal of money but because his father had always been so proud of his great pine woods he had never he said just felt like turning a sawmill loose in them now he was trading a pleasant old farm that didnt bring in anything for a gramagrass ranch which ought to turn over a profit of ten or twelve thousand dollars in good cattle years and wouldnt lose much in bad ones he expected to spend about half his time out there with ralph when im away he remarked genially you and mahailey wont have so much to do you can devote yourselves to embroidery so to speak if ralph is to live in colorado and you are to be away from home half of the time i dont see what is to become of this place murmured mrs wheeler still in the dark not necessary for you to see evangeline her husband replied stretching his big frame until the rocking chair creaked under him it will be claudes business to look after that claude mrs wheeler brushed a lock of hair back from her damp forehead in vague alarm of course he looked with twinkling eyes at his sons straight silent figure in the corner youve had about enough theology i presume no ambition to be a preacher this winter i mean to turn the farm over to you and give you a chance to straighten things out youve been dissatisfied with the way the place is run for some time havent you go ahead and put new blood into it new ideas if you want to ive no objection theyre expensive but let it go you can fire dan if you want and get what help you need claude felt as if a trap had been sprung on him he shaded his eyes with his hand i dont think im competent to run the place right he said unsteadily well you dont think i am either claude so were up against it its always been my notion that the land was made for man just as its old dawsons that man was created to work the land i dont mind your siding with the dawsons in this difference of opinion if you can get their results mrs wheeler rose and slipped quickly from the room feeling her way down the dark staircase to the kitchen it was dusky and quiet there mahailey sat in a corner hemming dishtowels by the light of a smoky old brass lamp which was her own cherished luminary mrs wheeler walked up and down the long room in soft silent agitation both hands pressed tightly to her breast where there was a physical ache of sympathy for claude she remembered kind tom wested he had stayed over night with them several times and had come to them for consolation after his wife died it seemed to her that his decline in health and loss of courage mr wheelers fortuitous trip to denver the old pinewood farm in maine were all things that fitted together and made a net to envelop her unfortunate son she knew that he had been waiting impatiently for the autumn and that for the first time he looked forward eagerly to going back to school he was homesick for his friends the erlichs and his mind was all the time upon the history course he meant to take yet all this would weigh nothing in the family councils probably he would not even speak of itand he had not one substantial objection to offer to his fathers wishes his disappointment would be bitter why it will almost break his heart she murmured aloud mahailey was a little deaf and heard nothing she sat holding her work up to the light driving her needle with a big brass thimble nodding with sleepiness between stitches though mrs wheeler was scarcely conscious of it the old womans presence was a comfort to her as she walked up and down with her drifting uncertain step she had left the sittingroom because she was afraid claude might get angry and say something hard to his father and because she couldnt bear to see him hectored claude had always found life hard to live he suffered so much over little thingsand she suffered with him for herself she never felt disappointments her husbands careless decisions did not disconcert her if he declared that he would not plant a garden at all this year she made no protest it was mahailey who grumbled if he felt like eating roast beef and went out and killed a steer she did the best she could to take care of the meat and if some of it spoiled she tried not to worry when she was not lost in religious meditation she was likely to be thinking about some one of the old books she read over and over her personal life was so far removed from the scene of her daily activities that rash and violent men could not break in upon it but where claude was concerned she lived on another plane dropped into the lower air tainted with human breath and pulsating with poor blind passionate human feelings it had always been so and now as she grew older and her flesh had almost ceased to be concerned with pain or pleasure like the wasted wax images in old churches it still vibrated with his feelings and became quick again for him his chagrins shrivelled her when he was hurt and suffered silently something ached in her on the other hand when he was happy a wave of physical contentment went through her if she wakened in the night and happened to think that he had been happy lately she would lie softly and gratefully in her warm place rest rest perturbed spirit she sometimes whispered to him in her mind when she wakened thus and thought of him there was a singular light in his eyes when he smiled at her on one of his good days as if to tell her that all was well in his inner kingdom she had seen that same look again and again and she could always remember it in the darka quick blue flash tender and a little wild as if he had seen a vision or glimpsed bright uncertainties xiii the next few weeks were busy ones on the farm before the wheat harvest was over nat wheeler packed his leather trunk put on his store clothes and set off to take tom welted back to maine during his absence ralph began to outfit for life in yucca county ralph liked being a great man with the frankfort merchants and he had never before had such an opportunity as this he bought a new shot gun saddles bridles boots long and short storm coats a set of furniture for his own room a fireless cooker another music machine and had them shipped to colorado his mother who did not like phonograph music and detested phonograph monologues begged him to take the machine at home but he assured her that she would be dull without it on winter evenings he wanted one of the latest make put out under the name of a great american inventor some of the ranches near westeds were owned by new york men who brought their families out there in the summer ralph had heard about the dances they gave and he way counting on being one of the guests he asked claude to give him his dress suit since claude wouldnt be needing it any more you can have it if you want it said claude indifferently but it wont fit you ill take it in to fritz and have the pants cut off a little and the shoulders taken in his brother replied lightly claude was impassive go ahead but if that old dutch man takes a whack at it it will look like the devil i think ill let him try father wont say anything about what ive ordered for the house but he isnt much for glad rags you know without more ado he threw claudes black clothes into the back seat of the ford and ran into town to enlist the services of the german tailor mr wheeler when he returned thought ralph had been rather free in expenditures but ralph told him it wouldnt do to take over the new place too modestly the ranchers out there are all highfliers if we go to squeezing nickels they wont think we mean business the country neighbours who were always amused at the wheelers doings got almost as much pleasure out of ralphs lavishness as he did himself one said ralph had shipped a new piano out to yucca county another heard he had ordered a billiard table august yoeder their prosperous german neighbour asked grimly whether he could maybe get a place as hired man with ralph leonard dawson who was to be married in october hailed claude in town one day and shouted my god claude theres nothing left in the furniture store for me and susie ralphs bought everything but the coffins he must be going to live like a prince out there i dont know anything about it claude answered coolly its not my enterprise no youve got to stay on the old place and make it pay the debts i understand leonard jumped into his car so that claude wouldnt have a chance to reply mrs wheeler too when she observed the magnitude of these preparations began to feel that the new arrangement was not fair to claude since he was the older boy and much the steadier claude had always worked hard when he was at home and made a good field hand while ralph had never done much but tinker with machinery and run errands in his car she couldnt understand why he was selected to manage an undertaking in which so much money was invested why claude she said dreamily one day if your father were an older man i would almost think his judgment had begun to fail wont we get dreadfully into debt at this rate dont say anything mother its fathers money he shant think i want any of it i wish i could talk to bayliss has he said anything not to me he hasnt ralph and mr wheeler took another flying trip to colorado and when they came back ralph began coaxing his mother to give him bedding and table linen he said he wasnt going to live like a savage even in the sand hills mahailey was outraged to see the linen she had washed and ironed and taken care of for so many years packed into boxes she was out of temper most of the time now and went about muttering to herself the only possessions mahailey brought with her when she came to live with the wheelers were a feather bed and three patchwork quilts interlined with wool off the backs of virginia sheep washed and carded by hand the quilts had been made by her old mother and given to her for a marriage portion the patchwork on each was done in a different design one was the popular logcabin pattern another the laurelleaf the third the blazing star this quilt mahailey thought too good for use and she had told mrs wheeler that she was saving it to give mr claude when he got married she slept on her feather bed in winter and in summer she put it away in the attic the attic was reached by a ladder which because of her weak back mrs wheeler very seldom climbed up there mahailey had things her own way and thither she often retired to air the bedding stored away there or to look at the pictures in the piles of old magazines ralph facetiously called the attic mahaileys library one day while things were being packed for the western ranch mrs wheeler going to the foot of the ladder to call mahailey narrowly escaped being knocked down by a large feather bed which came plumping through the trap door a moment later mahailey herself descended backwards holding to the rungs with one hand and in the other arm carrying her quilts why mahailey gasped mrs wheeler its not winter yet whatever are you getting your bed for im just agoin to lay on my fedder bed she broke out or direcly i wont have none i aint agoin to have mr ralph carryin off my quilts my mudder pieced fur me mrs wheeler tried to reason with her but the old woman took up her bed in her arms and staggered down the hall with it muttering and tossing her head like a horse in flytime that afternoon ralph brought a barrel and a bundle of straw into the kitchen and told mahailey to carry up preserves and canned fruit and he would pack them she went obediently to the cellar and ralph took off his coat and began to line the barrel with straw he was some time in doing this but still mahailey had not returned he went to the head of the stairs and whistled im acomin mr ralph im acomin dont hurry me i dont want to break nothin ralph waited a few minutes what are you doing down there mahailey he fumed i could have emptied the whole cellar by this time i suppose ill have to do it myself im acomin youd git yourself all dusty down here she came breathlessly up the stairs carrying a hamper basket full of jars her hands and face streaked with black well i should say it is dusty ralph snorted you might clean your fruit closet once in awhile you know mahailey you ought to see how mrs dawson keeps hers now lets see he sorted the jars on the table take back the grape jelly if theres anything i hate its grape jelly i know you have lots of it but you cant work it off on me and when you come up dont forget the pickled peaches i told you particularly the pickled peaches we aint got no pickled peaches mahailey stood by the cellar door holding a corner of her apron up to her chin with a queer animal look of stubbornness in her face no pickled peaches what nonsense mahailey i saw you making them here only a few weeks ago i know you did mr ralph but they aint none now i didnt have no luck with my peaches this year i must a let the air git at em they all worked on me an i had to throw em out ralph was thoroughly annoyed i never heard of such a thing mahailey you get more careless every year think of wasting all that fruit and sugar does mother know mahaileys low brow clouded i reckon she does i dont wase your mudders sugar i never did wase nothin she muttered her speech became queerer than ever when she was angry ralph dashed down the cellar stairs lit a lantern and searched the fruit closet sure enough there were no pickled peaches when he came back and began packing his fruit mahailey stood watching him with a furtive expression very much like the look that is in a chained coyotes eyes when a boy is showing him off to visitors and saying he wouldnt run away if he could go on with your work ralph snapped dont stand there watching me that evening claude was sitting on the windmill platform down by the barn after a hard days work ploughing for winter wheat he was solacing himself with his pipe no matter how much she loved him or how sorry she felt for him his mother could never bring herself to tell him he might smoke in the house lights were shining from the upstairs rooms on the hill and through the open windows sounded the singing snarl of a phonograph a figure came stealing down the path he knew by her low padding step that it was mahailey with her apron thrown over her head she came up to him and touched him on the shoulder in a way which meant that what she had to say was confidential mr claude mr ralphs done packed up a barrl of your mudders jelly an pickles to take out there thats all right mahailey mr wested was a widower and i guess there wasnt anything of that sort put up at his place she hesitated and bent lower he asked me fur them pickled peaches i made fur you but i didnt give him none i hid em all in my old cookstove we done put down cellar when mr ralph bought the new one i didnt give him your mudders new preserves nudder i give him the old last years stuff we had left over and now you an your mudderll have plenty claude laughed oh i dont care if ralph takes all the fruit on the place mahailey she shrank back a little saying confusedly no i know you dont mr claude i know you dont i surely ought not to take it out on her claude thought when he saw her disappointment he rose and patted her on the back thats all right mahailey thank you for saving the peaches anyhow she shook her finger at him dont you let on he promised and watched her slipping back over the zigzag path up the hill xiv ralph and his father moved to the new ranch the last of august and mr wheeler wrote back that late in the fall he meant to ship a carload of grass steers to the home farm to be fattened during the winter this claude saw would mean a need for fodder there was a fiftyacre corn field west of the creekjust on the skyline when one looked out from the west windows of the house claude decided to put this field into winter wheat and early in september he began to cut and bind the corn that stood upon it for fodder as soon as the corn was gathered he would plough up the ground and drill in the wheat when he planted the other wheat fields this was claudes first innovation and it did not meet with approval when bayliss came out to spend sunday with his mother he asked her what claude thought he was doing anyhow if he wanted to change the crop on that field why didnt he plant oats in the spring and then get into wheat next fall cutting fodder and preparing the ground now would only hold him back in his work when mr wheeler came home for a short visit he jocosely referred to that quarter as claudes wheat field claude went ahead with what he had undertaken to do but all through september he was nervous and apprehensive about the weather heavy rains if they came would make him late with his wheatplanting and then there would certainly be criticism in reality nobody cared much whether the planting was late or not but claude thought they did and sometimes in the morning he awoke in a state of panic because he wasnt getting ahead faster he had dan and one of august yoeders four sons to help him and he worked early and late the new field he ploughed and drilled himself he put a great deal of young energy into it and buried a great deal of discontent in its dark furrows day after day he flung himself upon the land and planted it with what was fermenting in him glad to be so tired at night that he could not think ralph came home for leonard dawsons wedding on the first of october all the wheelers went to the wedding even mahailey and there was a great gathering of the country folk and townsmen after ralph left claude had the place to himself again and the work went on as usual the stock did well and there were no vexatious interruptions the fine weather held and every morning when claude got up another gold day stretched before him like a glittering carpet leading when the question where the days were leading struck him on the edge of his bed he hurried to dress and get downstairs in time to fetch wood and coal for mahailey they often reached the kitchen at the same moment and she would shake her finger at him and say you come down to help me you nice boy you at least he was of some use to mahailey his father could hire one of the yoeder boys to look after the place but mahailey wouldnt let any one else save her old back mrs wheeler as well as mahailey enjoyed that fall she slept late in the morning and read and rested in the afternoon she made herself some new housedresses out of a grey material claude chose its almost like being a bride keeping house for just you claude she sometimes said soon claude had the satisfaction of seeing a blush of green come up over his brown wheat fields visible first in the dimples and little hollows then flickering over the knobs and levels like a fugitive smile he watched the green blades coming every day when he and dan went afield with their wagons to gather corn claude sent dan to shuck on the north quarter and he worked on the south he always brought in one more load a day than dan didthat was to be expected dan explained this very reasonably claude thought one afternoon when they were hooking up their teams its all right for you to jump at that corn like you was abeating carpets claude its your corn or anyways its your paws them fields will always lay betwixt you and trouble but a hired mans got no property but his back and he has to save it i figure that ive only got about so many jumps left in me and i aint agoing to jump too hard at no mans corn whats the matter i havent been hinting that you ought to jump any harder have i no you aint but i just want you to know that theres reason in all things with this dan got into his wagon and drove off he had probably been meditating upon this declaration for some time that afternoon claude suddenly stopped flinging white ears into the wagon beside him it was about five oclock the yellowest hour of the autumn day he stood lost in a forest of light dry rustling corn leaves quite hidden away from the world taking off his huskinggloves he wiped the sweat from his face climbed up to the wagon box and lay down on the ivorycoloured corn the horses cautiously advanced a step or two and munched with great content at ears they tore from the stalks with their teeth claude lay still his arms under his head looking up at the hard polished blue sky watching the flocks of crows go over from the fields where they fed on shattered grain to their nests in the trees along lovely creek he was thinking about what dan had said while they were hitching up there was a great deal of truth in it certainly yet as for him he often felt that he would rather go out into the world and earn his bread among strangers than sweat under this halfresponsibility for acres and crops that were not his own he knew that his father was sometimes called a land hog by the country people and he himself had begun to feel that it was not right they should have so much landto farm or to rent or to leave idle as they chose it was strange that in all the centuries the world had been going the question of property had not been better adjusted the people who had it were slaves to it and the people who didnt have it were slaves to them he sprang down into the gold light to finish his load warm silence nestled over the cornfield sometimes a light breeze rose for a moment and rattled the stiff dry leaves and he himself made a great rustling and crackling as he tore the husks from the ears greedy crows were still cawing about before they flapped homeward when he drove out to the highway the sun was going down and from his seat on the load he could see far and near yonder was dans wagon coming in from the north quarter over there was the roof of leonard dawsons new house and his windmill standing up black in the declining day before him were the bluffs of the pasture and the little trees almost bare huddled in violet shadow along the creek and the wheeler farmhouse on the hill its windows all aflame with the last red fire of the sun xv claude dreaded the inactivity of the winter to which the farmer usually looks forward with pleasure he made the thanksgiving football game a pretext for going up to lincolnwent intending to stay three days and stayed ten the first night when he knocked at the glass door of the erlichs sittingroom and took them by surprise he thought he could never go back to the farm approaching the house on that clear frosty autumn evening crossing the lawn strewn with crackling dry leaves he told himself that he must not hope to find things the same but they were the same the boys were lounging and smoking about the square table with the lamp on it and mrs erlich was at the piano playing one of mendelssohns songs without words when he knocked otto opened the door and called a surprise for you mother guess whos here what a welcome she gave him and how much she had to tell him while they were all talking at once henry the oldest son came downstairs dressed for a colonial ball with satin breeches and stockings and a sword his brothers began to point out the inaccuracies of his costume telling him that he couldnt possibly call himself a french emigré unless he wore a powdered wig henry took a book of memoirs from the shelf to prove to them that at the time when the french emigrés were coming to philadelphia powder was going out of fashion during this discussion mrs erlich drew claude aside and told him in excited whispers that her cousin wilhelmina the singer had at last been relieved of the invalid husband whom she had supported for so many years and now was going to marry her accompanist a man much younger than herself after the french emigré had gone off to his party two young instructors from the university dropped in and mrs erlich introduced claude as her landed proprietor who managed a big ranch out in one of the western counties the instructors took their leave early but claude stayed on what was it that made life seem so much more interesting and attractive here than elsewhere there was nothing wonderful about this room a lot of books a lamp comfortable hardused furniture some people whose lives were in no way remarkableand yet he had the sense of being in a warm and gracious atmosphere charged with generous enthusiasms and ennobled by romantic friendships he was glad to see the same pictures on the wall to find the swiss woodcutter on the mantel still bending under his load of faggots to handle again the heavy brass paperknife that in its time had cut so many interesting pages he picked it up from the cover of a red book lying thereone of trevelyans volumes on garibaldi which julius told him he must read before he was another week older the next afternoon claude took mrs erlich to the football game and came home with the family for dinner he lingered on day after day but after the first few evenings his heart was growing a little heavier all the time the erlich boys had so many new interests he couldnt keep up with them they had been going on and he had been standing still he wasnt conceited enough to mind that the thing that hurt was the feeling of being out of it of being lost in another kind of life in which ideas played but little part he was a stranger who walked in and sat down here but he belonged out in the big lonely country where people worked hard with their backs and got tired like the horses and were too sleepy at night to think of anything to say if mrs erlich and her hungarian woman made lentil soup and potato dumplings and wienerschnitzel for him it only made the plain fare on the farm seem the heavier when the second friday came round he went to bid his friends goodbye and explained that he must be going home tomorrow on leaving the house that night he looked back at the ruddy windows and told himself that it was goodbye indeed and not as mrs erlich had fondly said auf wiedersehen coming here only made him more discontented with his lot his frail claim on this kind of life existed no longer he must settle down into something that was his own take hold of it with both hands no matter how grim it was the next day during his journey out through the bleak winter country he felt that he was going deeper and deeper into reality claude had not written when he would be home but on saturday there were always some of the neighbours in town he rode out with one of the yoeder boys and from their place walked on the rest of the way he told his mother he was glad to be back again he sometimes felt as if it were disloyal to her for him to be so happy with mrs erlich his mother had been shut away from the world on a farm for so many years and even before that vermont was no very stimulating place to grow up in he guessed she had not had a chance any more than he had at those things which make the mind more supple and keep the feeling young the next morning it was snowing outside and they had a long pleasant sunday breakfast mrs wheeler said they wouldnt try to go to church as claude must be tired he worked about the place until noon making the stock comfortable and looking after things that dan had neglected in his absence after dinner he sat down at the secretary and wrote a long letter to his friends in lincoln whenever he lifted his eyes for a moment he saw the pasture bluffs and the softly falling snow there was something beautiful about the submissive way in which the country met winter it made one contentedsad too he sealed his letter and lay down on the couch to read the paper but was soon asleep when he awoke the afternoon was already far gone the clock on the shelf ticked loudly in the still room the coal stove sent out a warm glow the blooming plants in the south bowwindow looked brighter and fresher than usual in the soft white light that came up from the snow mrs wheeler was reading by the west window looking away from her book now and then to gaze off at the grey sky and the muffled fields the creek made a winding violet chasm down through the pasture and the trees followed it in a black thicket curiously tufted with snow claude lay for some time without speaking watching his mothers profile against the glass and thinking how good this soft clinging snowfall would be for his wheat fields what are you reading mother he asked presently she turned her head toward him nothing very new i was just beginning paradise lost again i havent read it for a long while read aloud wont you just wherever you happen to be i like the sound of it mrs wheeler always read deliberately giving each syllable its full value her voice naturally soft and rather wistful trailed over the long measures and the threatening biblical names all familiar to her and full of meaning a dungeon horrible on all sides round as one great furnace flamed yet from the flames no light but rather darkness visible served only to discover sights of woe her voice groped as if she were trying to realize something the room was growing greyer as she read on through the turgid catalogue of the heathen gods so packed with stories and pictures so unaccountably glorious at last the light failed and mrs wheeler closed the book thats fine claude commented from the couch but milton couldnt have got along without the wicked could he mrs wheeler looked up is that a joke she asked slyly oh no not at all it just struck me that this part is so much more interesting than the books about perfect innocence in eden and yet i suppose it shouldnt be so mrs wheeler said slowly as if in doubt her son laughed and sat up smoothing his rumpled hair the fact remains that it is dear mother and if you took all the great sinners out of the bible youd take out all the interesting characters wouldnt you except christ she murmured yes except christ but i suppose the jews were honest when they thought him the most dangerous kind of criminal are you trying to tangle me up his mother inquired with both reproach and amusement in her voice claude went to the window where she was sitting and looked out at the snowy fields now becoming blue and desolate as the shadows deepened i only mean that even in the bible the people who were merely free from blame didnt amount to much ah i see mrs wheeler chuckled softly you are trying to get me back to faith and works theres where you always balked when you were a little fellow well claude i dont know as much about it as i did then as i get older i leave a good deal more to god i believe he wants to save whatever is noble in this world and that he knows more ways of doing it than i she rose like a gentle shadow and rubbed her cheek against his flannel shirtsleeve murmuring i believe he is sometimes where we would least expect to find himeven in proud rebellious hearts for a moment they clung together in the pale clear square of the west window as the two natures in one person sometimes meet and cling in a fated hour xvi ralph and his father came home to spend the holidays and on christmas day bayliss drove out from town for dinner he arrived early and after greeting his mother in the kitchen went up to the sittingroom which shone with a holiday neatness and for once was warm enough for baylisshaving a low circulation he felt the cold acutely he walked up and down jingling the keys in his pockets and admiring his mothers winter chrysanthemums which were still blooming several times he paused before the oldfashioned secretary looking through the glass doors at the volumes within the sight of some of those books awoke disagreeable memories when he was a boy of fourteen or fifteen it used to make him bitterly jealous to hear his mother coaxing claude to read aloud to her bayliss had never been bookish even before he could read when his mother told him stories he at once began to prove to her how they could not possibly be true later he found arithmetic and geography more interesting than robinson crusoe if he sat down with a book he wanted to feel that he was learning something his mother and claude were always talking over his head about the people in books and stories though bayliss had a sentimental feeling about coming home he considered that he had had a lonely boyhood at the country school he had not been happy he was the boy who always got the answers to the test problems when the others didnt and he kept his arithmetic papers buttoned up in the inside pocket of his little jacket until he modestly handed them to the teacher never giving a neighbour the benefit of his cleverness leonard dawson and other lusty lads of his own age made life as terrifying for him as they could in winter they used to throw him into a snowdrift and then run away and leave him in summer they made him eat live grasshoppers behind the schoolhouse and put big bullsnakes in his dinner pail to surprise him to this day bayliss liked to see one of those fellows get into difficulties that his big fists couldnt get him out of it was because bayliss was quick at figures and undersized for a farmer that his father sent him to town to learn the implement business from the day he went to work he managed to live on his small salary he kept in his vest pocket a little daybook wherein he noted down all his expenditureslike the millionaire about whom the baptist preachers were never tired of talkingand his offering to the contribution box stood out conspicuous in his weekly account in bayliss voice even when he used his insinuating drawl and said disagreeable things there was something a little plaintive the expression of a deepseated sense of injury he felt that he had always been misunderstood and underestimated later after he went into business for himself the young men of frankfort had never urged him to take part in their pleasures he had not been asked to join the tennis club or the whist club he envied claude his fine physique and his unreckoning impulsive vitality as if they had been given to his brother by unfair means and should rightly have been his bayliss and his father were talking together before dinner when claude came in and was so inconsiderate as to put up a window though he knew his brother hated a draft in a moment bayliss addressed him without looking at him i see your friends the erlichs have bought out the jenkinson company in lincoln at least theyve given their notes claude had promised his mother to keep his temper today yes i saw it in the paper i hope theyll succeed i doubt it bayliss shook his head with his wisest look i understand theyve put a mortgage on their home that old woman will find herself without a roof one of these days i dont think so the boys have wanted to go into business together for a long while they are all intelligent and industrious why shouldnt they get on claude flattered himself that he spoke in an easy confidential way bayliss screwed up his eyes i expect theyre too fond of good living theyll pay their interest and spend whatevers left entertaining their friends i didnt see the young fellows name in the notice of incorporation julius do they call him julius is going abroad to study this fall he intends to be a professor whats the matter with him does he have poor health at this moment the dinner bell sounded ralph ran down from his room where he had been dressing and they all descended to the kitchen to greet the turkey the dinner progressed pleasantly bayliss and his father talked politics and ralph told stories about his neighbours in yucca county bayliss was pleased that his mother had remembered he liked oyster stuffing and he complimented her upon her mince pies when he saw her pour a second cup of coffee for herself and for claude at the end of dinner he said in a gentle grieved tone im sorry to see you taking two mother mrs wheeler looked at him over the coffeepot with a droll guilty smile i dont believe coffee hurts me a particle bayliss of course it does its a stimulant what worse could it be his tone implied when you said anything was a stimulant you had sufficiently condemned it there was no more noxious word claude was in the upper hall putting on his coat to go down to the barn and smoke a cigar when bayliss came out from the sittingroom and detained him by an indefinite remark i believe theres to be a musical show in hastings saturday night claude said he had heard something of the sort i was thinking bayliss affected a careless tone as if he thought of such things every day that we might make a party and take gladys and enid the roads are pretty good its a hard drive home so late at night claude objected bayliss meant of course that claude should drive the party up and back in mr wheelers big car bayliss never used his glistening cadillac for long rough drives i guess mother would put us up overnight and we neednt take the girls home till sunday morning ill get the tickets youd better arrange it with the girls then ill drive you of course if you want to go claude escaped and went out wishing that bayliss would do his own courting and not drag him into it bayliss who didnt know one tune from another certainly didnt want to go to this concert and it was doubtful whether enid royce would care much about going gladys farmer was the best musician in frankfort and she would probably like to hear it claude and gladys were old friends from their high school days though they hadnt seen much of each other while he was going to college several times this fall bayliss had asked claude to go somewhere with him on a sunday and then stopped to pick gladys up as he said claude didnt like it he was disgusted anyhow when he saw that bayliss had made up his mind to marry gladys she and her mother were so poor that he would probably succeed in the end though so far gladys didnt seem to give him much encouragement marrying bayliss he thought would be no joke for any woman but gladys was the one girl in town whom he particularly ought not to marry she was as extravagant as she was poor though she taught in the frankfort high school for twelve hundred a year she had prettier clothes than any of the other girls except enid royce whose father was a rich man her new hats and suede shoes were discussed and criticized year in and year out people said if she married bayliss wheeler he would soon bring her down to hard facts some hoped she would and some hoped she wouldnt as for claude he had kept away from mrs farmers cheerful parlour ever since bayliss had begun to drop in there he was disappointed in gladys when he was offended he seldom stopped to reason about his state of feeling he avoided the person and the thought of the person as if it were a sore spot in his mind xvii it had been mr wheelers intention to stay at home until spring but ralph wrote that he was having trouble with his foreman so his father went out to the ranch in february a few days after his departure there was a storm which gave people something to talk about for a year to come the snow began to fall about noon on st valentines day a soft thick wet snow that came down in billows and stuck to everything later in the afternoon the wind rose and wherever there was a shed a tree a hedge or even a clump of tall weeds drifts began to pile up mrs wheeler looking anxiously out from the sittingroom windows could see nothing but driving waves of soft white which cut the tall house off from the rest of the world claude and dan down in the corral where they were provisioning the cattle against bad weather found the air so thick that they could scarcely breathe their ears and mouths and nostrils were full of snow their faces plastered with it it melted constantly upon their clothing and yet they were white from their boots to their caps as they workedthere was no shaking it off the air was not cold only a little below freezing when they came in for supper the drifts had piled against the house until they covered the lower sashes of the kitchen windows and as they opened the door a frail wall of snow fell in behind them mahailey came running with her broom and pail to sweep it up aint it a turrible storm mr claude i reckon poor mr ernest wont git over tonight will he you never mind honey ill wipe up that water run along and git dry clothes on you an take a bath or youll ketch cold th ole tanks full of hot water for you exceptional weather of any kind always delighted mahailey mrs wheeler met claude at the head of the stairs theres no danger of the steers getting snowed under along the creek is there she asked anxiously no i thought of that weve driven them all into the little corral on the level and shut the gates its over my head down in the creek bottom now i havent a dry stitch on me i guess ill follow mahaileys advice and get in the tub if you can wait supper for me put your clothes outside the bathroom door and ill see to drying them for you yes please ill need them tomorrow i dont want to spoil my new corduroys and mother see if you can make dan change hes too wet and steamy to sit at the table with tell him if anybody has to go out after supper ill go mrs wheeler hurried down stairs dan she knew would rather sit all evening in wet clothes than take the trouble to put on dry ones he tried to sneak past her to his own quarters behind the washroom and looked aggrieved when he heard her message i aint got no other outside clothes except my sunday ones he objected well claude says hell go out if anybody has to i guess youll have to change for once dan or go to bed without your supper she laughed quietly at his dejected expression as he slunk away mrs wheeler mahailey whispered cant i run down to the cellar an git some of them nice strawberry preserves mr claude he loves em on his hot biscuit he dont eat the honey no more hes got tired of it very well ill make the coffee good and strong that will please him more than anything claude came down feeling clean and warm and hungry as he opened the stair door he sniffed the coffee and frying ham and when mahailey bent over the oven the warm smell of browning biscuit rushed out with the heat these combined odours somewhat dispersed dans gloom when he came back in squeaky sunday shoes and a bunglesome cutaway coat the latter was not required of him but he wore it for revenge during supper mrs wheeler told them once again how long ago when she was first married there were no roads or fences west of frankfort one winter night she sat on the roof of their first dugout nearly all night holding up a lantern tied to a pole to guide mr wheeler home through a snowstorm like this mahailey moving about the stove watched over the group at the table she liked to see the men fill themselves with foodthough she did not count dan a man by any means and she looked out to see that mrs wheeler did not forget to eat altogether as she was apt to do when she fell to remembering things that had happened long ago mahailey was in a happy frame of mind because her weather predictions had come true only yesterday she had told mrs wheeler there would be snow because she had seen snowbirds she regarded supper as more than usually important when claude put on his velvet close as she called his brown corduroys after supper claude lay on the couch in the sitting room while his mother read aloud to him from bleak houseone of the few novels she loved poor jo was drawing toward his end when claude suddenly sat up mother i believe im too sleepy ill have to turn in do you suppose its still snowing he rose and went to look out but the west windows were so plastered with snow that they were opaque even from the one on the south he could see nothing for a moment then mahailey must have carried her lamp to the kitchen window beneath for all at once a broad yellow beam shone out into the choked air and down it millions of snowflakes hurried like armies an unceasing progression moving as close as they could without forming a solid mass claude struck the frozen windowframe with his fist lifted the lower sash and thrusting out his head tried to look abroad into the engulfed night there was a solemnity about a storm of such magnitude it gave one a feeling of infinity the myriads of white particles that crossed the rays of lamplight seemed to have a quiet purpose to be hurrying toward a definite end a faint purity like a fragrance almost too fine for human senses exhaled from them as they clustered about his head and shoulders his mother looking under his lifted arm strained her eyes to see out into that swarming movement and murmured softly in her quavering voice ever thicker thicker thicker froze the ice on lake and river ever deeper deeper deeper fell the snow oer all the landscape xviii claudes bedroom faced the east the next morning when he looked out of his windows only the tops of the cedars in the front yard were visible hurriedly putting on his clothes he ran to the west window at the end of the hall lovely creek and the deep ravine in which it flowed had disappeared as if they had never been the rough pasture was like a smooth field except for humps and mounds like haycocks where the snow had drifted over a post or a bush at the kitchen stairs mahailey met him in gleeful excitement lord a mercy mr claude i cant git the storm door open were snowed in fas she looked like a tramp woman in a jacket patched with many colours her head tied up in an old black fascinator with ravelled yarn hanging down over her face like wild locks of hair she kept this costume for calamitous occasions appeared in it when the waterpipes were frozen and burst or when spring storms flooded the coops and drowned her young chickens the storm door opened outward claude put his shoulder to it and pushed it a little way then with mahaileys fireshovel he dislodged enough snow to enable him to force back the door dan came tramping in his stockingfeet across the kitchen to his boots which were still drying behind the stove shes sure a bad one claude he remarked blinking yes i guess we wont try to go out till after breakfast well have to dig our way to the barn and i never thought to bring the shovels up last night th ole snow shovels is in the cellar ill git em not now mahailey give us our breakfast before you do anything else mrs wheeler came down pinning on her little shawl her shoulders more bent than usual claude she said fearfully the cedars in the front yard are all but covered do you suppose our cattle could be buried he laughed no mother the cattle have been moving around all night i expect when the two men started out with the wooden snow shovels mrs wheeler and mahailey stood in the doorway watching them for a short distance from the house the path they dug was like a tunnel and the white walls on either side were higher than their heads on the breast of the hill the snow was not so deep and they made better headway they had to fight through a second heavy drift before they reached the barn where they went in and warmed themselves among the horses and cows dan was for getting next a warm cow and beginning to milk not yet said claude i want to have a look at the hogs before we do anything here the hoghouse was built down in a draw behind the barn when claude reached the edge of the gully blown almost bare he could look about him the draw was full of snow smooth except in the middle where there was a rumpled depression resembling a great heap of tumbled bedlinen dan gasped god a mighty claude the roofs fell in them hogsll be smothered they will if we dont get at them pretty quick run to the house and tell mother mahailey will have to milk this morning and get back here as fast as you can the roof was a flat thatch and the weight of the snow had been too much for it claude wondered if he should have put on a new thatch that fall but the old one wasnt leaky and had seemed strong enough when dan got back they took turns one going ahead and throwing out as much snow as he could the other handling the snow that fell back after an hour or so of this work dan leaned on his shovel well never do it claude two men couldnt throw all that snow out in a week im about all in well you can go back to the house and sit by the fire claude called fiercely he had taken off his coat and was working in his shirt and sweater the sweat was rolling from his face his back and arms ached and his hands which he couldnt keep dry were blistered there were thirtyseven hogs in the hoghouse dan sat down in the hole maybe if i could git a drink of water i could hold on aways he said dejectedly it was past noon when they got into the shed a cloud of steam rose and they heard grunts they found the pigs all lying in a heap at one end and pulled the top ones off alive and squealing twelve hogs at the bottom of the pile had been suffocated they lay there wet and black in the snow their bodies warm and smoking but they were dead there was no mistaking that mrs wheeler in her husbands rubber boots and an old overcoat came down with mahailey to view the scene of disaster you ought to git right at them hawgs an butcher em today mahailey called down to the men she was standing on the edge of the draw in her patched jacket and ravelled hood claude down in the hole brushed the sleeve of his sweater across his streaming face butcher them he cried indignantly i wouldnt butcher them if i never saw meat again you aint agoin to let all that good hawgmeat go to wase air you mr claude mahailey pleaded they didnt have no sickness nor nuthin only youll have to git right at em or the meat wont be healthy it wouldnt be healthy for me anyhow i dont know what i will do with them but im mighty sure i wont butcher them dont bother him mahailey mrs wheeler cautioned her hes tired and he has to fix some place for the live hogs i know he is mam but i could easy cut up one of them hawgs myself i butchered my own little pig onct in virginia i could save the hams anyways and the spareribs we aint had no spareribs for ever so long what with the ache in his back and his chagrin at losing the pigs claude was feeling desperate mother he shouted if you dont take mahailey into the house ill go crazy that evening mrs wheeler asked him how much the twelve hogs would have been worth in money he looked a little startled oh i dont know exactly three hundred dollars anyway would it really be as much as that i dont see how we could have prevented it do you her face looked troubled claude went to bed immediately after supper but he had no sooner stretched his aching body between the sheets than he began to feel wakeful he was humiliated at losing the pigs because they had been left in his charge but for the loss in money about which even his mother was grieved he didnt seem to care he wondered whether all that winter he hadnt been working himself up into a childish contempt for moneyvalues when ralph was home at christmas time he wore on his little finger a heavy gold ring with a diamond as big as a pea surrounded by showy grooves in the metal he admitted to claude that he had won it in a poker game ralphs hands were never free from automobile greasethey were the red stumpy kind that couldnt be kept clean claude remembered him milking in the barn by lantern light his jewel throwing off jabbing sparkles of colour and his fingers looking very much like the teats of the cow that picture rose before him now as a symbol of what successful farming led to the farmer raised and took to market things with an intrinsic value wheat and corn as good as could be grown anywhere in the world hogs and cattle that were the best of their kind in return he got manufactured articles of poor quality showy furniture that went to pieces carpets and draperies that faded clothes that made a handsome man look like a clown most of his money was paid out for machineryand that too went to pieces a steam thrasher didnt last long a horse outlived three automobiles claude felt sure that when he was a little boy and all the neighbours were poor they and their houses and farms had more individuality the farmers took time then to plant fine cottonwood groves on their places and to set osage orange hedges along the borders of their fields now these trees were all being cut down and grubbed up just why nobody knew they impoverished the land they made the snow drift nobody had them any more with prosperity came a kind of callousness everybody wanted to destroy the old things they used to take pride in the orchards which had been nursed and tended so carefully twenty years ago were now left to die of neglect it was less trouble to run into town in an automobile and buy fruit than it was to raise it the people themselves had changed he could remember when all the farmers in this community were friendly toward each other now they were continually having lawsuits their sons were either stingy and grasping or extravagant and lazy and they were always stirring up trouble evidently it took more intelligence to spend money than to make it when he pondered upon this conclusion claude thought of the erlichs julius could go abroad and study for his doctors degree and live on less than ralph wasted every year ralph would never have a profession or a trade would never do or make anything the world needed nor did claude find his own outlook much better he was twentyone years old and he had no skill no trainingno ability that would ever take him among the kind of people he admired he was a clumsy awkward farmer boy and even mrs erlich seemed to think the farm the best place for him probably it was but all the same he didnt find this kind of life worth the trouble of getting up every morning he could not see the use of working for money when money brought nothing one wanted mrs erlich said it brought security sometimes he thought this security was what was the matter with everybody that only perfect safety was required to kill all the best qualities in people and develop the mean ones ernest too said its the best life in the world claude but if you went to bed defeated every night and dreaded to wake in the morning then clearly it was too good a life for you to be assured at his age of three meals a day and plenty of sleep was like being assured of a decent burial safety security if you followed that reasoning out then the unborn those who would never be born were the safest of all nothing could happen to them claude knew and everybody else knew seemingly that there was something wrong with him he had been unable to conceal his discontent mr wheeler was afraid he was one of those visionary fellows who make unnecessary difficulties for themselves and other people mrs wheeler thought the trouble with her son was that he had not yet found his saviour bayliss was convinced that his brother was a moral rebel that behind his reticence and his guarded manner he concealed the most dangerous opinions the neighbours liked claude but they laughed at him and said it was a good thing his father was well fixed claude was aware that his energy instead of accomplishing something was spent in resisting unalterable conditions and in unavailing efforts to subdue his own nature when he thought he had at last got himself in hand a moment would undo the work of days in a flash he would be transformed from a wooden post into a living boy he would spring to his feet turn over quickly in bed or stop short in his walk because the old belief flashed up in him with an intense kind of hope an intense kind of painthe conviction that there was something splendid about life if he could but find it ix the weather after the big storm behaved capriciously there was a partial thaw which threatened to flood everythingthen a hard freeze the whole country glittered with an icy crust and people went about on a platform of frozen snow quite above the level of ordinary life claude got out mr wheelers old double sleigh from the mass of heterogeneous objects that had for years lain on top of it and brought the rusty sleighbells up to the house for mahailey to scour with brick dust now that they had automobiles most of the farmers had let their old sleighs go to pieces but the wheelers always kept everything claude told his mother he meant to take enid royce for a sleighride enid was the daughter of jason royce the grain merchant one of the early settlers who for many years had run the only grist mill in frankfort county she and claude were old playmates he made a formal call at the millhouse as it was called every summer during his vacation and often dropped in to see mr royce at his town office immediately after supper claude put the two wiry little blacks pompey and satan to the sleigh the moon had been up since long before the sun went down had been hanging pale in the sky most of the afternoon and now it flooded the snowterraced land with silver it was one of those sparkling winter nights when a boy feels that though the world is very big he himself is bigger that under the whole crystalline blue sky there is no one quite so warm and sentient as himself and that all this magnificence is for him the sleighbells rang out with a kind of musical lightheartedness as if they were glad to sing again after the many winters they had hung rusty and dustchoked in the barn the mill road that led off the highway and down to the river had pleasant associations for claude when he was a youngster every time his father went to mill he begged to go along he liked the mill and the miller and the millers little girl he had never liked the millers house however and he was afraid of enids mother even now as he tied his horses to the long hitchbar down by the engine room he resolved that he would not be persuaded to enter that formal parlour full of newlooking expensive furniture where his energy always deserted him and he could never think of anything to talk about if he moved his shoes squeaked in the silence and mrs royce sat and blinked her sharp little eyes at him and the longer he stayed the harder it was to go enid herself came to the door why its claude she exclaimed wont you come in no i want you to go riding ive got the old sleigh out come on its a fine night i thought i heard bells wont you come in and see mother while i get my things on claude said he must stay with his horses and ran back to the hitchbar enid didnt keep him waiting long she wasnt that kind she came swiftly down the path and through the front gate in the maine seal motorcoat she wore when she drove her coupe in cold weather now which way claude asked as the horses sprang forward and the bells began to jingle almost any way what a beautiful night and i love your bells claude i havent heard sleighbells since you used to bring me and gladys home from school in stormy weather why dont we stop for her tonight she has furs now you know here enid laughed all the old ladies are so terribly puzzled about them they cant find out whether your brother really gave them to her for christmas or not if they were sure she bought them for herself i believe theyd hold a public meeting claude cracked his whip over his eager little blacks doesnt it make you tired the way they are always nagging at gladys it would if she minded but shes just as serene they must have something to fuss about and of course poor mrs farmers back taxes are piling up i certainly suspect bayliss of the furs claude did not feel as eager to stop for gladys as he had been a few moments before they were approaching the town now and lighted windows shone softly across the blue whiteness of the snow even in progressive frankfort the street lights were turned off on a night so glorious as this mrs farmer and her daughter had a little white cottage down in the south part of the town where only people of modest means lived we must stop to see gladys mother if only for a minute enid said as they drew up before the fence she is so fond of company claude tied his team to a tree and they went up to the narrow sloping porch hung with vines that were full of frozen snow mrs farmer met them a large rosy woman of fifty with a pleasant kentucky voice she took enids arm affectionately and claude followed them into the long low sittingroom which had an uneven floor and a lamp at either end and was scantily furnished in rickety mahogany there close beside the hardcoal burner sat bayliss wheeler he did not rise when they entered but said hello folks in a rather sheepish voice on a little table beside mrs farmers workbasket was the box of candy he had lately taken out of his overcoat pocket still tied up with its gold cord a tall lamp stood beside the piano where gladys had evidently been practising claude wondered whether bayliss actually pretended to an interest in music at this moment gladys was in the kitchen mrs farmer explained looking for her mothers glasses mislaid when she was copying a recipe for a cheese soufflé are you still getting new recipes mrs farmer enid asked her i thought you could make every dish in the world already oh not quite mrs farmer laughed modestly and showed that she liked compliments do sit down claude she besought of the stiff image by the door daughter will be here directly at that moment gladys farmer appeared why i didnt know you had company mother she said coming in to greet them this meant claude supposed that bayliss was not company he scarcely glanced at gladys as he took the hand she held out to him one of gladys grandfathers had come from antwerp and she had the settled composure the full red lips brown eyes and dimpled white hands which occur so often in flemish portraits of young women some people thought her a trifle heavy too mature and positive to be called pretty even though they admired her rich tuliplike complexion gladys never seemed aware that her looks and her poverty and her extravagance were the subject of perpetual argument but went to and from school every day with the air of one whose position is assured her musicianship gave her a kind of authority in frankfort enid explained the purpose of their call claude has got out his old sleigh and weve come to take you for a ride perhaps bayliss will go too bayliss said he guessed he would though claude knew there was nothing he hated so much as being out in the cold gladys ran upstairs to put on a warm dress and enid accompanied her leaving mrs farmer to make agreeable conversation between her two incompatible guests bayliss was just telling us how you lost your hogs in the storm claude what a pity she said sympathetically yes claude thought bayliss wouldnt be at all reticent about that incident i suppose there was really no way to save them mrs farmer went on in her polite way her voice was low and round like her daughters different from the high tight western voice so i hope you dont let yourself worry about it no i dont worry about anything as dead as those hogs were whats the use claude asked boldly thats right murmured mrs farmer rocking a little in her chair such things will happen sometimes and we ought not to take them too hard it isnt as if a person had been hurt is it claude shook himself and tried to respond to her cordiality and to the shabby comfort of her long parlour so evidently doing its best to be attractive to her friends there werent four steady legs on any of the stuffed chairs or little folding tables she had brought up from the south and the heavy gold moulding was half broken away from the oil portrait of her father the judge but she carried her poverty lightly as southern people did after the civil war and she didnt fret half so much about her back taxes as her neighbours did claude tried to talk agreeably to her but he was distracted by the sound of stifled laughter upstairs probably gladys and enid were joking about bayliss being there how shameless girls were anyhow people came to their front windows to look out as the sleigh dashed jingling up and down the village streets when they left town bayliss suggested that they drive out past the trevor place the girls began to talk about the two young new englanders trevor and brewster who had lived there when frankfort was still a tough little frontier settlement every one was talking about them now for a few days ago word had come that one of the partners amos brewster had dropped dead in his law office in hartford it was thirty years since he and his friend bruce trevor had tried to be great cattle men in frankfort county and had built the house on the round hill east of the town where they wasted a great deal of money very joyously claudes father always declared that the amount they squandered in carousing was negligible compared to their losses in commendable industrial endeavour the country mr wheeler said had never been the same since those boys left it he delighted to tell about the time when trevor and brewster went into sheep they imported a breeding ram from scotland at a great expense and when he arrived were so impatient to get the good of him that they turned him in with the ewes as soon as he was out of his crate consequently all the lambs were born at the wrong season came at the beginning of march in a blinding blizzard and the mothers died from exposure the gallant trevor took horse and spurred all over the county from one little settlement to another buying up nursing bottles and nipples to feed the orphan lambs the rich bottom land about the trevor place had been rented out to a truck gardener for years now the comfortable house with its billiardroom annexa wonder for that part of the country in its dayremained closed its windows boarded up it sat on the top of a round knoll a fine cottonwood grove behind it tonight as claude drove toward it the hill with its tall straight trees looked like a big fur cap put down on the snow why hasnt some one bought that house long ago and fixed it up enid remarked there is no building site around here to compare with it it looks like the place where the leading citizen of the town ought to live im glad you like it enid said bayliss in a guarded voice ive always had a sneaking fancy for the place myself those fellows back there never wanted to sell it but now the estates got to be settled up i bought it yesterday the deed is on its way to hartford for signature enid turned round in her seat why bayliss are you in earnest think of just buying the trevor place offhand as if it were any ordinary piece of real estate will you make over the house and live there some day i dont know about living there its too far to walk to my business and the road across this bottom gets pretty muddy for a car in the spring but its not far less than a mile if i once owned that spot id surely never let anybody else live there even carrie remembers it she often asks in her letters whether any one has bought the trevor place yet carrie royce enids older sister was a missionary in china well bayliss admitted i didnt buy it for an investment exactly i paid all it was worth enid turned to gladys who was apparently not listening youd be the one who could plan a mansion for trevor hill gladys you always have such original ideas about houses yes people who have no houses of their own often seem to have ideas about building said gladys quietly but i like the trevor place as it is i hate to think that one of them is dead people say they did have such good times up there bayliss grunted call it good times if you like the kids were still grubbing whiskey bottles out of the cellar when i first came to town of course if i decide to live there ill pull down that old trap and put up something modern he often took this gruff tone with gladys in public enid tried to draw the driver into the conversation there seems to be a difference of opinion here claude oh said gladys carelessly its bayliss property or soon will be he will build what he likes ive always known somebody would get that place away from me so im prepared get it away from you muttered bayliss amazed yes as long as no one bought it and spoiled it it was mine as much as it was anybodys claude said enid banteringly now both your brothers have houses where are you going to have yours i dont know that ill ever have one i think ill run about the world a little before i draw my plans he replied sarcastically take me with you claude said gladys in a tone of sudden weariness from that spiritless murmur enid suspected that bayliss had captured gladys hand under the buffalo robe grimness had settled down over the sleighing party even enid who was not highly sensitive to unuttered feelings saw that there was an uncomfortable constraint a sharp wind had come up bayliss twice suggested turning back but his brother answered pretty soon and drove on he meant that bayliss should have enough of it not until enid whispered reproachfully i really think you ought to turn were all getting cold did he realize that he had made his sleighing party into a punishment there was certainly nothing to punish enid for she had done her best and had tried to make his own bad manners less conspicuous he muttered a blundering apology to her when he lifted her from the sleigh at the mill house on his long drive home he had bitter thoughts for company he was so angry with gladys that he hadnt been able to bid her goodnight everything she said on the ride had nettled him if she meant to marry bayliss then she ought to throw off this affectation of freedom and independence if she did not mean to why did she accept favours from him and let him get into the habit of walking into her house and putting his box of candy on the table as all frankfort fellows did when they were courting certainly she couldnt make herself believe that she liked his society when they were classmates at the frankfort high school gladys was claudes aesthetic proxy it wasnt the proper thing for a boy to be too clean or too careful about his dress and manners but if he selected a girl who was irreproachable in these respects got his latin and did his laboratory work with her then all her personal attractions redounded to his credit gladys had seemed to appreciate the honour claude did her and it was not all on her own account that she wore such beautifully ironed muslin dresses when they went on botanical expeditions driving home after that miserable sleighride claude told himself that in so far as gladys was concerned he could make up his mind to the fact that he had been stung all along he had believed in her fine feelings believed implicitly now he knew she had none so fine that she couldnt pocket them when there was enough to be gained by it even while he said these things over and over his old conception of gladys down at the bottom of his mind remained persistently unchanged but that only made his state of feeling the more painful he was deeply hurtand for some reason youth when it is hurt likes to feel itself betrayed book two enid i one afternoon that spring claude was sitting on the long flight of granite steps that leads up to the state house in denver he had been looking at the collection of cliff dweller remains in the capitol and when he came out into the sunlight the faint smell of freshcut grass struck his nostrils and persuaded him to linger the gardeners were giving the grounds their first light mowing all the lawns on the hill were bright with daffodils and hyacinths a sweet warm wind blew over the grass drying the waterdrops there had been showers in the afternoon and the sky was still a tender rainy blue where it showed through the masses of swiftly moving clouds claude had been away from home for nearly a month his father had sent him out to see ralph and the new ranch and from there he went on to colorado springs and trinidad he had enjoyed travelling but now that he was back in denver he had that feeling of loneliness which often overtakes country boys in a city the feeling of being unrelated to anything of not mattering to anybody he had wandered about colorado springs wishing he knew some of the people who were going in and out of the houses wishing that he could talk to some of those pretty girls he saw driving their own cars about the streets if only to say a few words one morning when he was walking out in the hills a girl passed him then slowed her car to ask if she could give him a lift claude would have said that she was just the sort who would never stop to pick him up yet she did and she talked to him pleasantly all the way back to town it was only twenty minutes or so but it was worth everything else that happened on his trip when she asked him where she should put him down he said at the antlers and blushed so furiously that she must have known at once he wasnt staying there he wondered this afternoon how many discouraged young men had sat here on the state house steps and watched the sun go down behind the mountains every one was always saying it was a fine thing to be young but it was a painful thing too he didnt believe older people were ever so wretched over there in the golden light the mass of mountains was splitting up into four distinct ranges and as the sun dropped lower the peaks emerged in perspective one behind the other it was a lonely splendour that only made the ache in his breast the stronger what was the matter with him he asked himself entreatingly he must answer that question before he went home again the statue of kit carson on horseback down in the square pointed westward but there was no west in that sense any more there was still south america perhaps he could find something below the isthmus here the sky was like a lid shut down over the world his mother could see saints and martyrs behind it well in time he would get over all this he supposed even his father had been restless as a young man and had run away into a new country it was a storm that died down at lastbut what a pity not to do anything with it a waste of powerfor it was a kind of power he sprang to his feet and stood frowning against the ruddy light so deep in his struggling thoughts that he did not notice a man mounting from the lower terraces who stopped to look at him the stranger scrutinized claude with interest he saw a young man standing bareheaded on the long flight of steps his fists clenched in an attitude of arrested actionhis sandy hair his tanned face his tense figure coppercoloured in the oblique rays claude would have been astonished if he could have known how he seemed to this stranger ii the next morning claude stepped off the train at frankfort and had his breakfast at the station before the town was awake his family were not expecting him so he thought he would walk home and stop at the mill to see enid royce after all old friends were best he left town by the low road that wound along the creek the willows were all out in new yellow leaves and the sticky cottonwood buds were on the point of bursting birds were calling everywhere and now and then through the studded willow wands flashed the dazzling wing of a cardinal all over the dusty tancoloured wheatfields there was a tender mist of greenmillions of little fingers reaching up and waving lightly in the sun to the north and south claude could see the cornplanters moving in straight lines over the brown acres where the earth had been harrowed so fine that it blew off in clouds of dust to the roadside when a gust of wind rose gay little twisters came across the open fields corkscrews of powdered earth that whirled through the air and suddenly fell again it seemed as if there were a lark on every fence post singing for everything that was dumb for the great ploughed lands and the heavy horses in the rows and the men guiding the horses along the roadsides from under the dead weeds and wisps of dried bluestem the dandelions thrust up their clean bright faces if claude happened to step on one the acrid smell made him think of mahailey who had probably been out this very morning gouging the sod with her broken butcher knife and stuffing dandelion greens into her apron she always went for greens with an air of secrecy very early and sneaked along the roadsides stooping close to the ground as if she might be detected and driven away or as if the dandelions were wild things and had to be caught sleeping claude was thinking as he walked of how he used to like to come to mill with his father the whole process of milling was mysterious to him then and the mill house and the millers wife were mysterious even enid was a littleuntil he got her down in the bright sun among the cattails they used to play in the bins of clean wheat watch the flour coming out of the hopper and get themselves covered with white dust best of all he liked going in where the waterwheel hung dripping in its dark cave and quivering streaks of sunlight came in through the cracks to play on the green slime and the spotted jewelweed growing in the shale the mill was a place of sharp contrasts bright sun and deep shade roaring sound and heavy dripping silence he remembered how astonished he was one day when he found mr royce in gloves and goggles cleaning the millstones and discovered what harmless looking things they were the miller picked away at them with a sharp hammer until the sparks flew and claude still had on his hand a blue spot where a chip of flint went under the skin when he got too near jason royce must have kept his mill going out of sentiment for there was not much money in it now but milling had been his first business and he had not found many things in life to be sentimental about sometimes one still came upon him in dusty millers clothes giving his man a day off he had long ago ceased to depend on the risings and fallings of lovely creek for his power and had put in a gasoline engine the old dam now lay like a holler tooth as one of his men said grown up with weeds and willowbrush mr royces family affairs had never gone as well as his business he had not been blessed with a son and out of five daughters he had succeeded in bringing up only two people thought the mill house damp and unwholesome until he built a tenants cottage and got a married man to take charge of the mill mr royce was never able to keep his millers long they complained of the gloom of the house and said they could not get enough to eat mrs royce went every summer to a vegetarian sanatorium in michigan where she learned to live on nuts and toasted cereals she gave her family nourishment to be sure but there was never during the day a meal that a man could look forward to with pleasure or sit down to with satisfaction mr royce usually dined at the hotel in town nevertheless his wife was distinguished for certain brilliant culinary accomplishments her bread was faultless when a church supper was toward she was always called upon for her wonderful mayonnaise dressing or her angelfood cakesure to be the lightest and spongiest in any assemblage of cakes a deep preoccupation about her health made mrs royce like a woman who has a hidden grief or is preyed upon by a consuming regret it wrapped her in a kind of insensibility she lived differently from other people and that fact made her distrustful and reserved only when she was at the sanatorium under the care of her idolized doctors did she feel that she was understood and surrounded by sympathy her distrust had communicated itself to her daughters and in countless little ways had coloured their feelings about life they grew up under the shadow of being different and formed no close friendships gladys farmer was the only frankfort girl who had ever gone much to the mill house nobody was surprised when caroline royce the older daughter went out to china to be a missionary or that her mother let her go without a protest the royce women were strange anyhow people said with carrie gone they hoped enid would grow up to be more like other folk she dressed well came to town often in her car and was always ready to work for the church or the public library besides in frankfort enid was thought very prettyin itself a humanizing attribute she was slender with a small wellshaped head a smooth pale skin and large dark opaque eyes with heavy lashes the long line from the lobe of her ear to the tip of her chin gave her face a certain rigidity but to the old ladies who are the best critics in such matters this meant firmness and dignity she moved quickly and gracefully just brushing things rather than touching them so that there was a suggestion of flight about her slim figure of gliding away from her surroundings when the sunday school gave tableaux vivants enid was chosen for nydia the blind girl of pompeii and for the martyr in christ or diana the pallor of her skin the submissive inclination of her forehead and her dark unchanging eyes made one think of something early christian on this may morning when claude wheeler came striding up the mill road enid was in the yard standing by a trellis for vines built near the fence out from under the heavy shade of the trees she was raking the earth that had been spaded up the day before and making furrows in which to drop seeds from the turn of the road by the knotty old willows claude saw her pink starched dress and little white sunbonnet he hurried forward hello are you farming he called as he came up to the fence enid who was bending over at that moment rose quickly but without a start why claude i thought you were out west somewhere this is a surprise she brushed the earth from her hands and gave him her limp white fingers her arms bare below the elbow were thin and looked cold as if she had put on a summer dress too early i just got back this morning im walking out home what are you planting sweet peas you always have the finest ones in the country when i see a bunch of yours at church or anywhere i always know them yes im quite successful with my sweet peas she admitted the ground is rich down here and they get plenty of sun it isnt only your sweet peas nobody else has such lilacs or rambler roses and i expect you have the only wistaria vine in frankfort county mother planted that a long while ago when she first moved here she is very partial to wistaria im afraid well lose it one of these hard winters oh that would be a shame take good care of it you must put in a lot of time looking after these things anyway he spoke admiringly enid leaned against the fence and pushed back her little bonnet perhaps i take more interest in flowers than i do in people i often envy you claude you have so many interests he coloured i good gracious i dont have many im an awfully discontented sort of fellow i didnt care about going to school until i had to stop and then i was sore because i couldnt go back i guess ive been sulking about it all winter she looked at him with quiet astonishment i dont see why you should be discontented youre so free well arent you free too not to do what i want to the only thing i really want to do is to go out to china and help carrie in her work mother thinks im not strong enough but carrie was never very strong here she is better in china and i think i might be claude felt concern he had not seen enid since the sleighride when she had been gayer than usual now she seemed sunk in lassitude you must get over such notions enid you dont want to go wandering off alone like that it makes people queer isnt there plenty of missionary work to be done right here she sighed thats what everybody says but we all of us have a chance if well take it out there they havent its terrible to think of all those millions that live and die in darkness claude glanced up at the sombre mill house hidden in cedarsthen off at the bright dusty fields he felt as if he were a little to blame for enids melancholy he hadnt been very neighbourly this last year people can live in darkness here too unless they fight it look at me i told you ive been moping all winter we all feel friendly enough but we go plodding on and never get together you and i are old friends and yet we hardly ever see each other mother says youve been promising for two years to run up and have a visit with her why dont you come it would please her then i will ive always been fond of your mother she paused a moment absently twisting the strings of her bonnet then twitched it from her head with a quick movement and looked at him squarely in the bright light claude you havent really become a freethinker have you he laughed outright why what made you think i had everybody knows ernest havel is and people say you and he read that kind of books together has that got anything to do with our being friends yes it has i couldnt feel the same confidence in you ive worried about it a good deal well you just cut it out for one thing im not worth it he said quickly oh yes you are if worrying would do any good she shook her head at him reproachfully claude took hold of the fence pickets between them with both hands it will do good didnt i tell you there was missionary work to be done right here is that why youve been so standoffish with me the last few years because you thought i was an atheist i never you know liked ernest havel she murmured when claude left the mill and started homeward he felt that he had found something which would help him through the summer how fortunate he had been to come upon enid alone and talk to her without interruptionwithout once seeing mrs royces face always masked in powder peering at him from behind a drawn blind mrs royce had always looked old even long ago when she used to come into church with her little girlsa tiny woman in tiny highheeled shoes and a big hat with nodding plumes her black dress covered with bugles and jet that glittered and rattled and made her seem hard on the outside like an insect yes he must see to it that enid went about and saw more of other people she was too much with her mother and with her own thoughts flowers and foreign missionsher garden and the great kingdom of china there was something unusual and touching about her preoccupations something quite charming too women ought to be religious faith was the natural fragrance of their minds the more incredible the things they believed the more lovely was the act of belief to him the story of paradise lost was as mythical as the odyssey yet when his mother read it aloud to him it was not only beautiful but true a woman who didnt have holy thoughts about mysterious things far away would be prosaic and commonplace like a man iii during the next few weeks claude often ran his car down to the mill house on a pleasant evening and coaxed enid to go into frankfort with him and sit through a moving picture show or to drive to a neighbouring town the advantage of this form of companionship was that it did not put too great a strain upon ones conversational powers enid could be admirably silent and she was never embarrassed by either silence or speech she was cool and sure of herself under any circumstances and that was one reason why she drove a car so wellmuch better than claude indeed one sunday when they met after church she told claude that she wanted to go to hastings to do some shopping and they arranged that he should take her on tuesday in his fathers big car the town was about seventy miles to the northeast and from frankfort it was an inconvenient trip by rail on tuesday morning claude reached the mill house just as the sun was rising over the damp fields enid was on the front porch waiting for him wearing a blanket coat over her spring suit she ran down to the gate and slipped into the seat beside him good morning claude nobody else is up its going to be a glorious day isnt it splendid a little warm for this time of year you wont need that coat long for the first hour they found the roads empty all the fields were grey with dew and the early sunlight burned over everything with the transparent brightness of a fire that has just been kindled as the machine noiselessly wound off the miles the sky grew deeper and bluer and the flowers along the roadside opened in the wet grass there were men and horses abroad on every hill now soon they began to pass children on the way to school who stopped and waved their bright dinner pails at the two travellers by ten oclock they were in hastings while enid was shopping claude bought some white shoes and duck trousers he felt more interest than usual in his summer clothes they met at the hotel for lunch both very hungry and both satisfied with their mornings work seated in the dining room with enid opposite him claude thought they did not look at all like a country boy and girl come to town but like experienced people touring in their car will you make a call with me after dinner she asked while they were waiting for their dessert is it any one i know certainly brother weldon is in town his meetings are over and i was afraid he might be gone but he is staying on a few days with mrs gleason i brought some of carries letters along for him to read claude made a wry face he wont be delighted to see me we never got on well at school hes a regular muff of a teacher if you want to know he added resolutely enid studied him judicially im surprised to hear that hes such a good speaker youd better come along its so foolish to have a coolness with your old teachers an hour later the reverend arthur weldon received the two young people in mrs gleasons halfdarkened parlour where he seemed quite as much at home as that lady herself the hostess after chatting cordially with the visitors for a few moments excused herself to go to a p e o meeting every one rose at her departure and mr weldon approached enid took her hand and stood looking at her with his head inclined and his oblique smile this is an unexpected pleasure to see you again miss enid and you too claude turning a little toward the latter youve come up from frankfort together this beautiful day his tone seemed to say how lovely for you he directed most of his remarks to enid and as always avoided looking at claude except when he definitely addressed him you are farming this year claude i presume that is a great satisfaction to your father and mrs wheeler is quite well mr weldon certainly bore no malice but he always pronounced claudes name exactly like the word clod which annoyed him to be sure enid pronounced his name in the same way but either claude did not notice this or did not mind it from her he sank into a deep dark sofa and sat with his driving cap on his knee while brother weldon drew a chair up to the one open window of the dusky room and began to read carrie royces letters without being asked to do so he read them aloud and stopped to comment from time to time claude observed with disappointment that enid drank in all his platitudes just as mrs wheeler did he had never looked at weldon so long before the light fell full on the young mans pearshaped head and his thin rippled hair what in the world could sensible women like his mother and enid royce find to admire in this purring whitenecktied fellow enids dark eyes rested upon him with an expression of profound respect she both looked at him and spoke to him with more feeling than she ever showed toward claude you see brother weldon she said earnestly i am not naturally much drawn to people i find it hard to take the proper interest in the church work at home it seems as if i had always been holding myself in reserve for the foreign fieldby not making personal ties i mean if gladys farmer went to china everybody would miss her she could never be replaced in the high school she has the kind of magnetism that draws people to her but i have always been keeping myself free to do what carrie is doing there i know i could be of use claude saw it was not easy for enid to talk like this her face looked troubled and her dark eyebrows came together in a sharp angle as she tried to tell the young preacher exactly what was going on in her mind he listened with his habitual smiling attention smoothing the paper of the folded letter pages and murmuring yes i understand indeed miss enid when she pressed him for advice he said it was not always easy to know in what field one could be most useful perhaps this very restraint was giving her some spiritual discipline that she particularly needed he was careful not to commit himself not to advise anything unconditionally except prayer i believe that all things are made clear to us in prayer miss enid enid clasped her hands her perplexity made her features look sharper but it is when i pray that i feel this call the strongest it seems as if a finger were pointing me over there sometimes when i ask for guidance in little things i get none and only get the feeling that my work lies far away and that for it strength would be given me until i take that road christ withholds himself mr weldon answered her in a tone of relief as if something obscure had been made clear if that is the case miss enid i think we need have no anxiety if the call recurs to you in prayer and it is your saviours will then we can be sure that the way and the means will be revealed a passage from one of the prophets occurs to me at this moment and behold a way shall be opened up before thy feet walk thou in it we might say that this promise was originally meant for enid royce i believe god likes us to appropriate passages of his word personally this last remark was made playfully as if it were a kind of christian endeavour jest he rose and handed enid back the letters clearly the interview was over as enid drew on her gloves she told him that it had been a great help to talk to him and that he always seemed to give her what she needed claude wondered what it was he hadnt seen weldon do anything but retreat before her eager questions he an atheist could have given her stronger reinforcement claudes car stood under the maple trees in front of mrs gleasons house before they got into it he called enids attention to a mass of thunderheads in the west that looks to me like a storm it might be a wise thing to stay at the hotel tonight oh no i dont want to do that i havent come prepared he reminded her that it wouldnt be impossible to buy whatever she might need for the night i dont like to stay in a strange place without my own things she said decidedly im afraid well be going straight into it we may be in for something pretty roughbut its as you say he still hesitated with his hand on the door i think wed better try it she said with quiet determination claude had not yet learned that enid always opposed the unexpected and could not bear to have her plans changed by people or circumstances for an hour he drove at his best speed watching the clouds anxiously the tableland from horizon to horizon was glowing in sunlight and the sky itself seemed only the more brilliant for the mass of purple vapours rolling in the west with bright edges like newcut lead he had made fifty odd miles when the air suddenly grew cold and in ten minutes the whole shining sky was blotted out he sprang to the ground and began to jack up his wheels as soon as a wheel left the earth enid adjusted the chain claude told her he had never got the chains on so quickly before he covered the packages in the back seat with an oilcloth and drove forward to meet the storm the rain swept over them in waves seemed to rise from the sod as well as to fall from the clouds they made another five miles ploughing through puddles and sliding over liquefied roads suddenly the heavy car chains and all bounded up a twofoot bank shot over the sod a dozen yards before the brake caught it then swung a halfcircle and stood still enid sat calm and motionless claude drew a long breath if that had happened on a culvert wed be in the ditch with the car on top of us i simply cant control the thing the whole top soil is loose and theres nothing to hold to thats tommy rices place over there wed better get him to take us in for the night but that would be worse than the hotel enid objected they are not very clean people and there are a lot of children better be crowded than dead he murmured from here on it would be a matter of luck we might land anywhere we are only about ten miles from your place i can stay with your mother tonight its too dangerous enid i dont like the responsibility your father would blame me for taking such a chance i know its on my account youre nervous enid spoke reasonably enough do you mind letting me drive for awhile there are only three bad hills left and i think i can slide down them sideways ive often tried it claude got out and let her slip into his seat but after she took the wheel he put his hand on her arm dont do anything so foolish he pleaded enid smiled and shook her head she was amiable but inflexible he folded his arms go on he was chafed by her stubbornness but he had to admire her resourcefulness in handling the car at the bottom of one of the worst hills was a new cement culvert overlaid with liquid mud where there was nothing for the chains to grip the car slid to the edge of the culvert and stopped on the very brink while they were ploughing up the other side of the hill enid remarked its a good thing your starter works well a little jar would have thrown us over they pulled up at the wheeler farm just before dark and mrs wheeler came running out to meet them with a rubber coat over her head you poor drowned children she cried taking enid in her arms how did you ever get home i so hoped you had stayed in hastings it was enid who got us home claude told her shes a dreadfully foolhardy girl and somebody ought to shake her but shes a fine driver enid laughed as she brushed a wet lock back from her forehead you were right of course the sensible thing would have been to turn in at the rice place only i didnt want to later in the evening claude was glad they hadnt it was pleasant to be at home and to see enid at the supper table sitting on his fathers right and wearing one of his mothers new grey housedresses they would have had a dismal time at the rices with no beds to sleep in except such as were already occupied by rice children enid had never slept in his mothers guest room before and it pleased him to think how comfortable she would be there at an early hour mrs wheeler took a candle to light her guest to bed enid passed near claudes chair as she was leaving the room have you forgiven me she asked teasingly what made you so pigheaded did you want to frighten me or to show me how well you could drive neither i wanted to get home goodnight claude settled back in his chair and shaded his eyes she did feel that this was home then she had not been afraid of his fathers jokes or disconcerted by mahaileys knowing grin her ease in the household gave him unaccountable pleasure he picked up a book but did not read it was lying open on his knee when his mother came back half an hour later move quietly when you go upstairs claude she is so tired that she may be asleep already he took off his shoes and made his ascent with the utmost caution iv ernest havel was cultivating his bright glistening young cornfield one summer morning whistling to himself an old german song which was somehow connected with a picture that rose in his memory it was a picture of the earliest ploughing he could remember he saw a halfcircle of green hills with snow still lingering in the clefts of the higher ridges behind the hills rose a wall of sharp mountains covered with dark pine forests in the meadows at the foot of that sweep of hills there was a winding creek with polled willows in their first yellowgreen and brown fields he himself was a little boy playing by the creek and watching his father and mother plough with two great oxen that had rope traces fastened to their heads and their long horns his mother walked barefoot beside the oxen and led them his father walked behind guiding the plough his father always looked down his mothers face was almost as brown and furrowed as the fields and her eyes were pale blue like the skies of early spring the two would go up and down thus all morning without speaking except to the oxen ernest was the last of a long family and as he played by the creek he used to wonder why his parents looked so old leonard dawson drove his car up to the fence and shouted waking ernest from his revery he told his team to stand and ran out to the edge of the field hello ernest leonard called have you heard claude wheeler got hurt day before yesterday you dont say so it cant be anything bad or theyd let me know oh its nothing very bad i guess but he got his face scratched up in the wire quite a little it was the queerest thing i ever saw he was out with the team of mules and a heavy plough working the road in that deep cut between their place and mine the gasoline motortruck came along making more noise than usual maybe but those mules know a motor truck and what they did was pure cussedness they begun to rear and plunge in that deep cut i was working my corn over in the field and shouted to the gasoline man to stop but he didnt hear me claude jumped for the critters heads and got em by the bits but by that time he was all tangled up in the lines those damned mules lifted him off his feet and started to run down the draw and up the bank and across the fields they went with that big ploughblade jumping three or four feet in the air every clip i was sure it would cut one of the mules open or go clean through claude it would have got him too if he hadnt kept his hold on the bits they carried him right along swinging in the air and finally ran him into the barbwire fence and cut his face and neck up my goodness did he get cut bad no not very but yesterday morning he was out cultivating corn all stuck up with court plaster i knew that was a fool thing to do a wire cuts nasty if you get overheated out in the dust but you cant tell a wheeler anything now they say his face has swelled and is hurting him terrible and hes gone to town to see the doctor youd better go over there tonight and see if you can make him take care of himself leonard drove on and ernest went back to his team its queer about that boy he was thinking hes big and strong and hes got an education and all that fine land but he dont seem to fit in right sometimes ernest thought his friend was unlucky when that idea occurred to him he sighed and shook it off for ernest believed there was no help for that it was something rationalism did not explain the next afternoon enid royces coupe drove up to the wheeler farmyard mrs wheeler saw enid get out of her car and came down the hill to meet her breathless and distressed oh enid youve heard of claudes accident he wouldnt take care of himself and now hes got erysipelas hes in such pain poor boy enid took her arm and they started up the hill toward the house can i see claude mrs wheeler i want to give him these flowers mrs wheeler hesitated i dont know if he will let you come in dear i had hard work persuading him to see ernest for a few moments last night he seems so lowspirited and hes sensitive about the way hes bandaged up ill go to his room and ask him no just let me go up with you please if i walk in with you he wont have time to fret about it i wont stay if he doesnt wish it but i want to see him mrs wheeler was alarmed at this suggestion but enid ignored her uncertainty they went up to the third floor together and enid herself tapped at the door its i claude may i come in for a moment a muffled reluctant voice answered no they say this is catching enid and anyhow id rather you didnt see me like this without waiting she pushed open the door the dark blinds were down and the room was full of a strong bitter odor claude lay flat in bed his head and face so smothered in surgical cotton that only his eyes and the tip of his nose were visible the brown paste with which his features were smeared oozed out at the edges of the gauze and made his dressings look untidy enid took in these details at a glance does the light hurt your eyes let me put up one of the blinds for a moment because i want you to see these flowers ive brought you my first sweet peas claude blinked at the bunch of bright colours she held out before him she put them up to his face and asked him if he could smell them through his medicines in a moment he ceased to feel embarrassed his mother brought a glass bowl and enid arranged the flowers on the little table beside him now do you want me to darken the room again not yet sit down for a minute and talk to me i cant say much because my face is stiff i should think it would be i met leonard dawson on the road yesterday and he told me how you worked in the field after you were cut i would like to scold you hard claude do it might make me feel better he took her hand and kept her beside him a moment are those the sweet peas you were planting that day when i came back from the west yes havent they done well to blossom so early less than two months thats strange he sighed strange what oh that a handful of seeds can make anything so pretty in a few weeks and it takes a man so long to do anything and then its not much account thats not the way to look at things she said reprovingly enid sat prim and straight on a chair at the foot of his bed her flowered organdie dress was very much like the bouquet she had brought and her floppy straw hat had a big lilac bow she began to tell claude about her fathers several attacks of erysipelas he listened but absently he would never have believed that enid with her severe notions of decorum would come into his room and sit with him like this he noticed that his mother was quite as much astonished as he she hovered about the visitor for a few moments and then seeing that enid was quite at her ease went downstairs to her work claude wished that enid would not talk at all but would sit there and let him look at her the sunshine she had let into the room and her tranquil fragrant presence soothed him presently he realized that she was asking him something what is it enid the medicine they give me makes me stupid i dont catch things i was asking whether you play chess very badly father says i play passably well when you are better you must let me bring up my ivory chessmen that carrie sent me from china they are beautifully carved and now its time for me to go she rose and patted his hand telling him he must not be foolish about seeing people i didnt know you were so vain bandages are as becoming to you as they are to anybody shall i pull the dark blind again for you yes please there wont be anything to look at now why claude you are getting to be quite a ladies man something in the way enid said this made him wince a little he felt his burning face grow a shade warmer even after she went downstairs he kept wishing she had not said that his mother came to give him his medicine she stood beside him while he swallowed it enid royce is a real sensible girl she said as she took the glass her upward inflection expressed not conviction but bewilderment enid came every afternoon and claude looked forward to her visits restlessly they were the only pleasant things that happened to him and made him forget the humiliation of his poisoned and disfigured face he was disgusting to himself when he touched the welts on his forehead and under his hair he felt unclean and abject at night when his fever ran high and the pain began to tighten in his head and neck it wrought him to a distressing pitch of excitement he fought with it as one bulldog fights with another his mind prowled about among dark legends of tortureeverything he had ever read about the inquisition the rack and the wheel when enid entered his room cool and fresh in her pretty summer clothes his mind leaped to meet her he could not talk much but he lay looking at her and breathing in a sweet contentment after awhile he was well enough to sit up halfdressed in a steamer chair and play chess with her one afternoon they were by the west window in the sittingroom with the chess board between them and claude had to admit that he was beaten again it must be dull for you playing with me he murmured brushing the beads of sweat from his forehead his face was clean now so white that even his freckles had disappeared and his hands were the soft languid hands of a sick man you will play better when you are stronger and can fix your mind on it enid assured him she was puzzled because claude who had a good head for some things had none at all for chess and it was clear that he would never play well yes he sighed dropping back into his chair my wits do wander look at my wheatfield over there on the skyline isnt it lovely and now i wont be able to harvest it sometimes i wonder whether ill ever finish anything i begin enid put the chessmen back into their box now that you are better you must stop feeling blue father says that with your trouble people are always depressed claude shook his head slowly as it lay against the back of the chair no its not that its having so much time to think that makes me blue you see enid ive never yet done anything that gave me any satisfaction i must be good for something when i lie still and think i wonder whether my life has been happening to me or to somebody else it doesnt seem to have much connection with me i havent made much of a start but you are not twentytwo yet you have plenty of time to start is that what you are thinking about all the time she shook her finger at him i think about two things all the time that is one of them mrs wheeler came in with claudes four oclock milk it was his first day downstairs when they were children playing by the milldam claude had seen the future as a luminous vagueness in which he and enid would always do things together then there came a time when he wanted to do everything with ernest when girls were disturbing and a bother and he pushed all that into the distance knowing that some day he must reckon with it again now he told himself he had always known enid would come back and she had come on that afternoon when she entered his drugsmelling room and let in the sunlight she would have done that for nobody but him she was not a girl who would depart lightly from conventions that she recognized as authoritative he remembered her as she used to march up to the platform for childrens day exercises with the other little girls of the infant class in her stiff white dress never a curl awry or a wrinkle in her stocking keeping her little comrades in order by the acquiescent gravity of her face which seemed to say how pleasant it is to do thus and to do right old mr smith was the minister in those daysa good man who had been much tossed about by a stormy and temperamental wifeand his eyes used to rest yearningly upon little enid royce seeing in her the promise of virtuous and comely christian womanhood to use one of his own phrases claude in the boys class across the aisle used to tease her and try to distract her but he respected her seriousness when they played together she was fairminded didnt whine if she got hurt and never claimed a girls exemption from anything unpleasant she was calm even on the day when she fell into the milldam and he fished her out as soon as she stopped choking and coughing up muddy water she wiped her face with her little drenched petticoats and sat shivering and saying over and over oh claude claude incidents like that one now seemed to him significant and fateful when claudes strength began to return to him it came overwhelmingly his blood seemed to grow strong while his body was still weak so that the inrush of vitality shook him the desire to live again sang in his veins while his frame was unsteady waves of youth swept over him and left him exhausted when enid was with him these feelings were never so strong her actual presence restored his equilibriumalmost this fact did not perplex him he fondly attributed it to something beautiful in the girls naturea quality so lovely and subtle that there is no name for it during the first days of his recovery he did nothing but enjoy the creeping stir of life respiration was a soft physical pleasure in the nights so long he could not sleep them through it was delightful to lie upon a cloud that floated lazily down the sky in the depths of this lassitude the thought of enid would start up like a sweet burning pain and he would drift out into the darkness upon sensations he could neither prevent nor control so long as he could plough pitch hay or break his back in the wheatfield he had been master but now he was overtaken by himself enid was meant for him and she had come for him he would never let her go she should never know how much he longed for her she would be slow to feel even a little of what he was feeling he knew that it would take a long while but he would be infinitely patient infinitely tender of her it should be he who suffered not she even in his dreams he never wakened her but loved her while she was still and unconscious like a statue he would shed love upon her until she warmed and changed without knowing why sometimes when enid sat unsuspecting beside him a quick blush swept across his face and he felt guilty toward her meek and humble as if he must beg her forgiveness for something often he was glad when she went away and left him alone to think about her her presence brought him sanity and for that he ought to be grateful when he was with her he thought how she was to be the one who would put him right with the world and make him fit into the life about him he had troubled his mother and disappointed his father his marriage would be the first natural dutiful expected thing he had ever done it would be the beginning of usefulness and content as his mothers oftrepeated psalm said it would restore his soul enids willingness to listen to him he could scarcely doubt her devotion to him during his illness was probably regarded by her friends as equivalent to an engagement v claudes first trip to frankfort was to get his hair cut after leaving the barbershop he presented himself glistening with bayrum at jason royces office mr royce in the act of closing his safe turned and took the young man by the hand hello claude glad to see you around again sickness cant do much to a husky young farmer like you with old fellows its another story im just starting off to have a look at my alfalfa south of the river get in and go along with me they went out to the open car that stood by the sidewalk and when they were spinning along between fields of ripening grain claude broke the silence i expect you know what i want to see you about mr royce the older man shook his head he had been preoccupied and grim ever since they started well claude went on modestly it oughtnt to surprise you to hear that ive set my heart on enid i havent said anything to her yet but if youre not against me im going to try to persuade her to marry me marriage is a final sort of thing claude said mr royce he sat slumping in his seat watching the road ahead of him with intense abstraction looking more gloomy and grizzled than usual enid is a vegetarian you know he remarked unexpectedly claude smiled that could hardly make any difference to me mr royce the other nodded slightly i know at your age you think it doesnt such things do make a difference however his lips closed over his halfdead cigar and for some time he did not open them enid is a good girl he said at last strictly speaking she has more brains than a girl needs if mrs royce had another daughter at home id take enid into my office she has good judgment i dont know but shed run a business better than a house having got this out mr royce relaxed his frown took his cigar from his mouth looked at it and put it back between his teeth without relighting it claude was watching him with surprise theres no question about enid mr royce i didnt come to ask you about her he exclaimed i came to ask if youd be willing to have me for a soninlaw i know and you know that enid could do a great deal better than to marry me i surely havent made much of a showing so far here we are announced mr royce ill leave the car under this elm and well go up to the north end of the field and have a look they crawled under the wire fence and started across the rough ground through a field of purple blossoms clouds of yellow butterflies darted up before them they walked jerkily breaking through the sunbaked crust into the soft soil beneath mr royce lit a fresh cigar and as he threw away the match let his hand drop on the young mans shoulder i always envied your father you took my fancy when you were a little shaver and i used to let you in to see the waterwheel when i gave up water power and put in an engine i said to myself theres just one fellow in the country will be sorry to see the old wheel go and thats claude wheeler i hope you dont think im too young to marry claude said as they tramped on no its right and proper a young man should marry i dont say anything against marriage mr royce protested doggedly you may find some opposition in enids missionary motives i dont know how she feels about that now i dont enquire id be pleased to see her get rid of such notions they dont do a woman any good i want to help her get rid of them if its all right with you i hope i can persuade enid to marry me this fall jason royce turned his head quickly toward his companion studied his artless hopeful countenance for a moment and then looked away with a frown the alfalfa field sloped upward at one corner lay like a bright greenandpurple handkerchief thrown down on the hillside at the uppermost angle grew a slender young cottonwood with leaves as light and agitated as the swarms of little butterflies that hovered above the clover mr royce made for this tree took off his black coat rolled it up and sat down on it in the flickering shade his shirt showed big blotches of moisture and the sweat was rolling in clear drops along the creases in his brown neck he sat with his hands clasped over his knees his heels braced in the soft soil and looked blankly off across the field he found himself absolutely unable to touch upon the vast body of experience he wished to communicate to claude it lay in his chest like a physical misery and the desire to speak struggled there but he had no words no way to make himself understood he had no argument to present what he wanted to do was to hold up life as he had found it like a picture to his young friend to warn him without explanation against certain heartbreaking disappointments it could not be done he saw the dead might as well try to speak to the living as the old to the young the only way that claude could ever come to share his secret was to live his strong yellow teeth closed tighter and tighter on the cigar which had gone out like the first he did not look at claude but while he watched the wind plough soft flowery roads in the field the boys face was clearly before him with its expression of reticent pride melting into the desire to please and the slight stiffness of his shoulders set in a kind of stubborn loyalty claude lay on the sod beside him rather tired after his walk in the sun a little melancholy though he did not know why after a long while mr royce unclasped his broad thickfingered millers hands and for a moment took out the macerated cigar well claude he said with determined cheerfulness well always be better friends than is common between father and soninlaw youll find out that pretty nearly everything you believe about lifeabout marriage especiallyis lies i dont know why people prefer to live in that sort of a world but they do vi after his interview with mr royce claude drove directly to the mill house as he came up the shady road he saw with disappointment the flash of two white dresses instead of one moving about in the sunny flower garden the visitor was gladys farmer this was her vacation time she had walked out to the mill in the cool of the morning to spend the day with enid now they were starting off to gather watercresses and had stopped in the garden to smell the heliotrope on this scorching afternoon the purple sprays gave out a fragrance that hung over the flowerbed and brushed their cheeks like a warm breath the girls looked up at the same moment and recognized claude they waved to him and hurried down to the gate to congratulate him on his recovery he took their little tin pails and followed them around the old damhead and up a sandy gorge along a clear thread of water that trickled into lovely creek just above the mill they came to the gravelly hill where the stream took its source from a spring hollowed out under the exposed roots of two elm trees all about the spring and in the sandy bed of the shallow creek the cresses grew cool and green gladys had strong feelings about places she looked around her with satisfaction of all the places where we used to play enid this was my favourite she declared you girls sit up there on the elm roots claude suggested wherever you put your foot in this soft gravel water gathers youll spoil your white shoes ill get the cress for you stuff my pail as full as you can then gladys called as they sat down i wonder why the spanish dagger grows so thick on this hill enid these plants were old and tough when we were little i love it here she leaned back upon the hot glistening hillside the sun came down in red rays through the elmtops and all the pebbles and bits of quartz glittered dazzlingly down in the stream bed the water where it caught the light twinkled like tarnished gold claudes sandy head and stooping shoulders were mottled with sunshine as they moved about over the green patches and his duck trousers looked much whiter than they were gladys was too poor to travel but she had the good fortune to be able to see a great deal within a few miles of frankfort and a warm imagination helped her to find life interesting she did as she confided to enid want to go to colorado she was ashamed of never having seen a mountain presently claude came up the bank with two shining dripping pails now may i sit down with you for a few minutes moving to make room for him beside her enid noticed that his thin face was heavily beaded with perspiration his pocket handkerchief was wet and sandy so she gave him her own with a proprietary air why claude you look quite tired have you been overdoing where were you before you came here i was out in the country with your father looking at his alfalfa and he walked you all over the field in the hot sun i suppose claude laughed he did well ill scold him tonight you stay here and rest i am going to drive gladys home gladys protested but at last consented that they should both drive her home in claudes car they lingered awhile however listening to the soft amiable bubbling of the spring a wise unobtrusive voice murmuring night and day continually telling the truth to people who could not understand it when they went back to the house enid stopped long enough to cut a bunch of heliotrope for mrs farmerthough with the sinking of the sun its rich perfume had already vanished they left gladys and her flowers and cresses at the gate of the white cottage now half hidden by gaudy trumpet vines claude turned his car and went back along the dim twilight road with enid i usually like to see gladys but when i found her with you this afternoon i was terribly disappointed for a minute id just been talking with your father and i wanted to come straight to you do you think you could marry me enid i dont believe it would be for the best claude she spoke sadly he took her passive hand why not my mind is full of other plans marriage is for most girls but not for all enid had taken off her hat in the low evening light claude studied her pale face under her brown hair there was something graceful and charming about the way she held her head something that suggested both submissiveness and great firmness ive had those faraway dreams too enid but now my thoughts dont get any further than you if you could care ever so little for me to start on id be willing to risk the rest she sighed you know i care for you ive never made any secret of it but were happy as we are arent we no im not ive got to have some life of my own or ill go to pieces if you wont have me ill try south americaand i wont come back until i am an old man and you are an old woman enid looked at him and they both smiled the mill house was black except for a light in one upstairs window claude sprang out of his car and lifted enid gently to the ground she let him kiss her soft cool mouth and her long lashes in the pale dusty dusk lit only by a few white stars and with the chill of the creek already in the air she seemed to claude like a shivering little ghost come up from the rushes where the old milldam used to be a terrible melancholy clutched at the boys heart he hadnt thought it would be like this he drove home feeling weak and broken was there nothing in the world outside to answer to his own feelings and was every turn to be fresh disappointment why was life so mysteriously hard this country itself was sad he thought looking about himand you could no more change that than you could change the story in an unhappy human face he wished to god he were sick again the world was too rough a place to get about in there was one person in the world who felt sorry for claude that night gladys farmer sat at her bedroom window for a long while watching the stars and thinking about what she had seen plainly enough that afternoon she had liked enid ever since they were little girlsand knew all there was to know about her claude would become one of those dead people that moved about the streets of frankfort everything that was claude would perish and the shell of him would come and go and eat and sleep for fifty years gladys had taught the children of many such dead men she had worked out a misty philosophy for herself full of strong convictions and confused figures she believed that all things which might make the world beautifullove and kindness leisure and artwere shut up in prison and that successful men like bayliss wheeler held the keys the generous ones who would let these things out to make people happy were somehow weak and could not break the bars even her own little life was squeezed into an unnatural shape by the domination of people like bayliss she had not dared for instance to go to omaha that spring for the three performances of the chicago opera company such an extravagance would have aroused a corrective spirit in all her friends and in the schoolboard as well they would probably have decided not to give her the little increase in salary she counted upon having next year there were people even in frankfort who had imagination and generous impulses but they were all she had to admit inefficientfailures there was miss livingstone the fiery emotional old maid who couldnt tell the truth old mr smith a lawyer without clients who read shakespeare and dryden all day long in his dusty office bobbie jones the effeminate drug clerk who wrote free verse and movie scenarios and tended the sodawater fountain claude was her one hope ever since they graduated from high school all through the four years she had been teaching she had waited to see him emerge and prove himself she wanted him to be more successful than bayliss and still be claude she would have made any sacrifice to help him on if a strong boy like claude so well endowed and so fearless must fail simply because he had that finer strain in his naturethen life was not worth the chagrin it held for a passionate heart like hers at last gladys threw herself upon the bed if he married enid that would be the end he would go about strong and heavy like mr royce a big machine with the springs broken inside vii claude was well enough to go into the fields before the harvest was over the middle of july came and the farmers were still cutting grain the yield of wheat and oats was so heavy that there were not machines enough to thrash it within the usual time men had to await their turn letting their grain stand in shock until a belching black engine lumbered into the field rains would have been disastrous but this was one of those good years which farmers tell about when everything goes well at the time they needed rain there was plenty of it and now the days were miracles of dry glittering heat every morning the sun came up a red ball quickly drank the dew and started a quivering excitement in all living things in great harvest seasons like that one the heat the intense light and the important work in hand draw people together and make them friendly neighbours helped each other to cope with the burdensome abundance of mannourishing grain women and children and old men fell to and did what they could to save and house it even the horses had a more varied and sociable existence than usual going about from one farm to another to help neighbour horses drag wagons and binders and headers they nosed the colts of old friends ate out of strange mangers and drank or refused to drink out of strange watertroughs decrepit horses that lived on a pension like the wheelers stifflegged molly and leonard dawsons billy with the heaveshis asthmatic cough could be heard for a quarter of a milewere pressed into service now it was wonderful too how well these invalided beasts managed to keep up with the strong young mares and geldings they bent their willing heads and pulled as if the chafing of the collar on their necks was sweet to them the sun was like a great visiting presence that stimulated and took its due from all animal energy when it flung wide its cloak and stepped down over the edge of the fields at evening it left behind it a spent and exhausted world horses and men and women grew thin seethed all day in their own sweat after supper they dropped over and slept anywhere at all until the red dawn broke clear in the east again like the fanfare of trumpets and nerves and muscles began to quiver with the solar heat for several weeks claude did not have time to read the newspapers they lay about the house in bundles unopened for nat wheeler was in the field now working like a giant almost every evening claude ran down to the mill to see enid for a few minutes he did not get out of his car and she sat on the old stile left over from horseback days while she chatted with him she said frankly that she didnt like men who had just come out of the harvest field and claude did not blame her he didnt like himself very well after his clothes began to dry on him but the hour or two between supper and bed was the only time he had to see anybody he slept like the heroes of old sank upon his bed as the thing he desired most on earth and for a blissful moment felt the sweetness of sleep before it overpowered him in the morning he seemed to hear the shriek of his alarm clock for hours before he could come up from the deep places into which he had plunged all sorts of incongruous adventures happened to him between the first buzz of the alarm and the moment when he was enough awake to put out his hand and stop it he dreamed for instance that it was evening and he had gone to see enid as usual while she was coming down the path from the house he discovered that he had no clothes on at all then with wonderful agility he jumped over the picket fence into a clump of castor beans and stood in the dusk trying to cover himself with the leaves like adam in the garden talking commonplaces to enid through chattering teeth afraid lest at any moment she might discover his plight mrs wheeler and mahailey always lost weight in thrashing time just as the horses did this year nat wheeler had six hundred acres of winter wheat that would run close upon thirty bushels to the acre such a harvest was as hard on the women as it was on the men leonard dawsons wife susie came over to help mrs wheeler but she was expecting a baby in the fall and the heat proved too much for her then one of the yoeder daughters came but the methodical german girl was so distracted by mahaileys queer ways that mrs wheeler said it was easier to do the work herself than to keep explaining mahaileys psychology day after day ten ravenous men sat down at the long dinner table in the kitchen mrs wheeler baked pies and cakes and bread loaves as fast as the oven would hold them and from morning till night the range was stoked like the firebox of a locomotive mahailey wrung the necks of chickens until her wrist swelled up as she said like a puffadder by the end of july the excitement quieted down the extra leaves were taken out of the dining table the wheeler horses had their barn to themselves again and the reign of terror in the henhouse was over one evening mr wheeler came down to supper with a bundle of newspapers under his arm claude i see this war scare in europe has hit the market wheats taken a jump theyre paying eightyeight cents in chicago we might as well get rid of a few hundred bushel before it drops again wed better begin hauling tomorrow you and i can make two trips a day over to vicount by changing teamstheres no grade to speak of mrs wheeler arrested in the act of pouring coffee sat holding the coffeepot in the air forgetting she had it if this is only a newspaper scare as we think i dont see why it should affect the market she murmured mildly surely those big bankers in new york and boston have some way of knowing rumour from fact give me some coffee please said her husband testily i dont have to explain the market ive only got to take advantage of it but unless theres some reason why are we dragging our wheat over to vicount do you suppose its some scheme the grain men are hiding under a war rumour have the financiers and the press ever deceived the public like this before i dont know a thing in the world about it evangeline and i dont suppose i telephoned the elevator at vicount an hour ago and they said theyd pay me seventy cents subject to change in the morning quotations claude with a twinkle in his eye youd better not go to mill tonight turn in early if we are on the road by six tomorrow well be in town before the heat of the day all right sir i want to look at the papers after supper i havent read anything but the headlines since before thrashing ernest was stirred up about the murder of that grand duke and said the austrians would make trouble but i never thought there was anything in it theres seventy cents a bushel in it anyway said his father reaching for a hot biscuit if theres that much im somehow afraid there will be more said mrs wheeler thoughtfully she had picked up the paper flybrush and sat waving it irregularly as if she were trying to brush away a swarm of confusing ideas you might call up ernest and ask him what the bohemian papers say about it mr wheeler suggested claude went to the telephone but was unable to get any answer from the havels they had probably gone to a barn dance down in the bohemian township he went upstairs and sat down before an armchair full of newspapers he could make nothing reasonable out of the smeary telegrams in big type on the front page of the omaha world herald the german army was entering luxembourg he didnt know where luxembourg was whether it was a city or a country he seemed to have some vague idea that it was a palace his mother had gone up to mahaileys library the attic to hunt for a map of europea thing for which nebraska farmers had never had much need but that night on many prairie homesteads the women american and foreignborn were hunting for a map claude was so sleepy that he did not wait for his mothers return he stumbled upstairs and undressed in the dark the night was sultry with thunder clouds in the sky and an unceasing play of sheetlightning all along the western horizon mosquitoes had got into his room during the day and after he threw himself upon the bed they began sailing over him with their high excruciating note he turned from side to side and tried to muffle his ears with the pillow the disquieting sound became merged in his sleepy brain with the big type on the front page of the paper those black letters seemed to be flying about his head with a soft high singsong whizz viii late in the afternoon of the sixth of august claude and his empty wagon were bumping along the level road over the flat country between vicount and the lovely creek valley he had made two trips to town that day though he had kept his heaviest team for the hot afternoon pull his horses were too tired to be urged off a walk their necks were marbled with sweat stains and their flanks were plastered with the white dust that rose at every step their heads hung down and their breathing was deep and slow the wood of the greenpainted wagon seat was blistering hot to the touch claude sat at one end of it his head bared to catch the faint stir of air that sometimes dried his neck and chin and saved him the trouble of pulling out a handkerchief on every side the wheat stubble stretched for miles and miles lonely straw stacks stood up yellow in the sun and cast long shadows claude peered anxiously along the distant locust hedges which told where the road ran ernest havel had promised to meet him somewhere on the way home he had not seen ernest for a week since then time had brought prodigies to birth at last he recognized the havels team along way off and he stopped and waited for ernest beside a thorny hedge looking thoughtfully about him the sun was already low it hung above the stubble all milky and rosy with the heat like the image of a sun reflected in grey water in the east the full moon had just risen and its thin silver surface was flushed with pink until it looked exactly like the setting sun except for the place each occupied in the heavens claude could not have told which was which they rested upon opposite rims of the world two bright shields and regarded each other as if they too had met by appointment claude and ernest sprang to the ground at the same instant and shook hands feeling that they had not seen each other for a long while well what do you make of it ernest the young man shook his head cautiously but replied no further he patted his horses and eased the collars on their necks i waited in town for the hastings paper claude went on impatiently england declared war last night the germans said ernest are at liege i know where that is i sailed from antwerp when i came over here yes i saw that can the belgians do anything nothing ernest leaned against the wagon wheel and drawing his pipe from his pocket slowly filled it nobody can do anything the german army will go where it pleases if its as bad as that why are the belgians putting up a fight i dont know its fine but it will come to nothing in the end let me tell you something about the german army claude pacing up and down beside the locust hedge ernest rehearsed the great argument preparation organization concentration inexhaustible resources inexhaustible men while he talked the sun disappeared the moon contracted solidified and slowly climbed the pale sky the fields were still glimmering with the bland reflection left over from daylight and the distance grew shadowynot dark but seemingly full of sleep if i were at home ernest concluded i would be in the austrian army this minute i guess all my cousins and nephews are fighting the russians or the belgians already how would you like it yourself to be marched into a peaceful country like this in the middle of harvest and begin to destroy it i wouldnt do it of course id desert and be shot then your family would be persecuted your brothers maybe even your father would be made orderlies to austrian officers and be kicked in the mouth i wouldnt bother about that id let my male relatives decide for themselves how often they would be kicked ernest shrugged his shoulders you americans brag like little boys you would and you wouldnt i tell you nobodys will has anything to do with this it is the harvest of all that has been planted i never thought it would come in my lifetime but i knew it would come the boys lingered a little while looking up at the soft radiance of the sky there was not a cloud anywhere and the low glimmer in the fields had imperceptibly changed to full pure moonlight presently the two wagons began to creep along the white road and on the backless seat of each the driver sat drooping forward lost in thought when they reached the corner where ernest turned south they said goodnight without raising their voices claudes horses went on as if they were walking in their sleep they did not even sneeze at the low cloud of dust beaten up by their heavy footfallsthe only sounds in the vast quiet of the night why was ernest so impatient with him claude wondered he could not pretend to feel as ernest did he had nothing behind him to shape his opinions or colour his feelings about what was going on in europe he could only sense it day by day he had always been taught that the german people were preeminent in the virtues americans most admire a month ago he would have said they had all the ideals a decent american boy would fight for the invasion of belgium was contradictory to the german character as he knew it in his friends and neighbours he still cherished the hope that there had been some great mistake that this splendid people would apologize and right itself with the world mr wheeler came down the hill bareheaded and coatless as claude drove into the barnyard i expect youre tired ill put your team away any news england has declared war mr wheeler stood still a moment and scratched his head i guess you neednt get up early tomorrow if this is to be a sure enough war wheat will go higher ive thought it was a bluff until now you take the papers up to your mother ix enid and mrs royce had gone away to the michigan sanatorium where they spent part of every summer and would not be back until october claude and his mother gave all their attention to the war despatches day after day through the first two weeks of august the bewildering news trickled from the little towns out into the farming country about the middle of the month came the story of the fall of the forts at liege battered at for nine days and finally reduced in a few hours by siege guns brought up from the rearguns which evidently could destroy any fortifications that ever had been or ever could be constructed even to these quiet wheatgrowing people the siege guns before liege were a menace not to their safety or their goods but to their comfortable established way of thinking they introduced the greaterthanman force which afterward repeatedly brought into this war the effect of unforeseeable natural disaster like tidal waves earthquakes or the eruption of volcanoes on the twentythird came the news of the fall of the forts at namur again giving warning that an unprecedented power of destruction had broken loose in the world a few days later the story of the wiping out of the ancient and peaceful seat of learning at louvain made it clear that this force was being directed toward incredible ends by this time too the papers were full of accounts of the destruction of civilian populations something new and certainly evil was at work among mankind nobody was ready with a name for it none of the wellworn words descriptive of human behaviour seemed adequate the epithets grouped about the name of attila were too personal too dramatic too full of old familiar human passion one afternoon in the first week of september mrs wheeler was in the kitchen making cucumber pickles when she heard claudes car coming back from frankfort in a moment he entered letting the screen door slam behind him and threw a bundle of mail on the table what do you think mother the french have moved the seat of government to bordeaux evidently they dont think they can hold paris mrs wheeler wiped her pale perspiring face with the hem of her apron and sat down in the nearest chair you mean that paris is not the capital of france any more can that be true thats what it looks like though the papers say its only a precautionary measure she rose lets go up to the map i dont remember exactly where bordeaux is mahailey you wont let my vinegar burn will you claude followed her to the sittingroom where her new map hung on the wall above the carpet lounge leaning against the back of a willow rockingchair she began to move her hand about over the brightly coloured shiny surface murmuring yes there is bordeaux so far to the south and there is paris claude behind her looked over her shoulder do you suppose they are going to hand their city over to the germans like a christmas present i should think theyd burn it first the way the russians did moscow they can do better than that now they can dynamite it dont say such things mrs wheeler dropped into the deep willow chair realizing that she was very tired now that she had left the stove and the heat of the kitchen she began weakly to wave the palm leaf fan before her face its said to be such a beautiful city perhaps the germans will spare it as they did brussels they must be sick of destruction by now get the encyclopaedia and see what it says ive left my glasses downstairs claude brought a volume from the bookcase and sat down on the lounge he began paris the capital city of france and the department of the seineshall i skip the history no read it all he cleared his throat and began again at its first appearance in history there was nothing to foreshadow the important part which paris was to play in europe and in the world etc mrs wheeler rocked and fanned forgetting the kitchen and the cucumbers as if they had never been her tired body was resting and her mind which was never tired was occupied with the account of early religious foundations under the merovingian kings her eyes were always agreeably employed when they rested upon the sunburned neck and catapult shoulders of her redheaded son claude read faster and faster until he stopped with a gasp mother there are pages of kings well read that some other time i want to find out what its like now and whether its going to have any more history he ran his finger up and down the columns here this looks like business defences paris in a recent german account of the greatest fortresses of the world possesses three distinct rings of defenceshere he broke off now what do you think of that a german account and this is an english book the world simply made a mistake about the germans all along its as if we invited a neighbour over here and showed him our cattle and barns and all the time he was planning how he would come at night and club us in our beds mrs wheeler passed her hand over her brow yet we have had so many german neighbours and never one that wasnt kind and helpful i know it everything mrs erlich ever told me about germany made me want to go there and the people that sing all those beautiful songs about women and children went into belgian villages and dont claude his mother put out her hands as if to push his words back read about the defences of paris thats what we must think about now i cant but believe there is one fort the germans didnt put down in their book and that it will stand we know paris is a wicked city but there must be many godfearing people there and god has preserved it all these years you saw in the paper how the churches are full all day of women praying she leaned forward and smiled at him indulgently and you believe those prayers will accomplish nothing son claude squirmed as he always did when his mother touched upon certain subjects well you see i cant forget that the germans are praying too and i guess they are just naturally more pious than the french taking up the book he began once more in the low ground again at the narrowest part of the great loop of the marne etc claude and his mother had grown familiar with the name of that river and with the idea of its strategic importance before it began to stand out in black headlines a few days later the fall ploughing had begun as usual mr wheeler had decided to put in six hundred acres of wheat again whatever happened on the other side of the world they would need bread he took a third team himself and went into the field every morning to help dan and claude the neighbours said that nobody but the kaiser had ever been able to get nat wheeler down to regular work since the men were all afield mrs wheeler now went every morning to the mailbox at the crossroads a quarter of a mile away to get yesterdays omaha and kansas city papers which the carrier left in her eagerness she opened and began to read them as she turned homeward and her feet never too sure took a wandering way among sunflowers and buffaloburrs one morning indeed she sat down on a red grass bank beside the road and read all the war news through before she stirred while the grasshoppers played leapfrog over her skirts and the gophers came out of their holes and blinked at her that noon when she saw claude leading his team to the water tank she hurried down to him without stopping to find her bonnet and reached the windmill breathless the french have stopped falling back claude they are standing at the marne there is a great battle going on the papers say it may decide the war it is so near paris that some of the army went out in taxicabs claude drew himself up well it will decide about paris anyway wont it how many divisions i cant make out the accounts are so confusing but only a few of the english are there and the french are terribly outnumbered your father got in before you and he has the papers upstairs they are twentyfour hours old ill go to vicount tonight after im done work and get the hastings paper in the evening when he came back from town he found his father and mother waiting up for him he stopped a moment in the sittingroom there is not much news except that the battle is on and practically the whole french army is engaged the germans outnumber them five to three in men and nobody knows how much in artillery general joffre says the french will fall back no farther he did not sit down but went straight upstairs to his room mrs wheeler put out the lamp undressed and lay down but not to sleep long afterward claude heard her gently closing a window and he smiled to himself in the dark his mother he knew had always thought of paris as the wickedest of cities the capital of a frivolous winedrinking catholic people who were responsible for the massacre of st bartholomew and for the grinning atheist voltaire for the last two weeks ever since the french began to fall back in lorraine he had noticed with amusement her growing solicitude for paris it was curious he reflected lying wide awake in the dark four days ago the seat of government had been moved to bordeauxwith the effect that paris seemed suddenly to have become the capital not of france but of the world he knew he was not the only farmer boy who wished himself tonight beside the marne the fact that the river had a pronounceable name with a hard western r standing like a keystone in the middle of it somehow gave ones imagination a firmer hold on the situation lying still and thinking fast claude felt that even he could clear the bar of french politenessso much more terrifying than german bulletsand slip unnoticed into that outnumbered army ones manners wouldnt matter on the marne tonight the night of the eighth of september 1914 there was nothing on earth he would so gladly be as an atom in that wall of flesh and blood that rose and melted and rose again before the city which had meant so much through all the centuriesbut had never meant so much before its name had come to have the purity of an abstract idea in great sleepy continents in landlocked harvest towns in the little islands of the sea for four days men watched that name as they might stand out at night to watch a comet or to see a star fall x it was sunday afternoon and claude had gone down to the mill house as enid and her mother had returned from michigan the day before mrs wheeler propped back in a rocking chair was reading and mr wheeler in his shirt sleeves his sunday collar unbuttoned was sitting at his walnut secretary amusing himself with columns of figures presently he rose and yawned stretching his arms above his head claude thinks he wants to begin building right away up on the quarter next the timber claim ive been figuring on the lumber building materials are cheap just now so i suppose id better let him go ahead mrs wheeler looked up absently from the page why i suppose so her husband sat down astride a chair and leaning his arms on the back of it looked at her what do you think of this match anyway i dont know as ive heard you say enid is a good christian girl mrs wheeler began resolutely but her sentence hung in the air like a question he moved impatiently yes i know but what does a husky boy like claude want to pick out a girl like that for why evangeline shell be the old woman over again apparently these misgivings were not new to mrs wheeler for she put out her hand to stop him and whispered in solemn agitation dont say anything dont breathe oh i wont interfere i never do id rather have her for a daughterinlaw than a wife by a long shot claudes more of a fool than i thought him he picked up his hat and strolled down to the barn but his wife did not recover her composure so easily she left the chair where she had hopefully settled herself for comfort took up a feather duster and began moving distractedly about the room brushing the surface of the furniture when the war news was bad or when she felt troubled about claude she set to cleaning house or overhauling the closets thankful to be able to put some little thing to rights in such a disordered world as soon as the fall planting was done claude got the well borers out from town to drill his new well and while they were at work he began digging his cellar he was building his house on the level stretch beside his fathers timber claim because when he was a little boy he had thought that grove of trees the most beautiful spot in the world it was a square of about thirty acres set out in ash and boxelder and cottonwoods with a thick mulberry hedge on the south side the trees had been neglected of late years but if he lived up there he could manage to trim them and care for them at odd moments every morning now he ran up in the ford and worked at his cellar he had heard that the deeper a cellar was the better it was and he meant that this one should be deep enough one day leonard dawson stopped to see what progress he was making standing on the edge of the hole he shouted to the lad who was sweating below my god claude what do you want of a cellar as deep as that when your wife takes a notion to go to china you can open a trapdoor and drop her through claude flung down his pick and ran up the ladder enids not going to have notions of that sort he said wrathfully well you neednt get mad im glad to hear it i was sorry when the other girl went it always looked to me like enid had her face set for china but i havent seen her for a good whilenot since before she went off to michigan with the old lady after leonard was gone claude returned to his work still out of humour he was not altogether happy in his mind about enid when he went down to the mill it was usually mr royce not enid who sought to detain him followed him down the path to the gate and seemed sorry to see him go he could not blame enid with any lack of interest in what he was doing she talked and thought of nothing but the new house and most of her suggestions were good he often wished she would ask for something unreasonable and extravagant but she had no selfish whims and even insisted that the comfortable upstairs sleeping room he had planned with such care should be reserved for a guest chamber as the house began to take shape enid came up often in her car to watch its growth to show claude samples of wallpapers and draperies or a design for a windowseat she had cut from some magazine there could be no question of her pride in every detail the disappointing thing was that she seemed more interested in the house than in him these months when they could be together as much as they pleased she treated merely as a period of time in which they were building a house everything would be all right when they were married claude told himself he believed in the transforming power of marriage as his mother believed in the miraculous effects of conversion marriage reduced all women to a common denominator changed a cool selfsatisfied girl into a loving and generous one it was quite right that enid should be unconscious now of everything that she was to be when she was his wife he told himself he wouldnt want it otherwise but he was lonely all the same he lavished upon the little house the solicitude and cherishing care that enid seemed not to need he stood over the carpenters urging the greatest nicety in the finish of closets and cupboards the convenient placing of shelves the exact joining of sills and casings often he stayed late in the evening after the workmen with their noisy boots had gone home to supper he sat down on a rafter or on the skeleton of the upper porch and quite lost himself in brooding in anticipation of things that seemed as far away as ever the dying light the quiet stars coming out were friendly and sympathetic one night a bird flew in and fluttered wildly about among the partitions shrieking with fright before it darted out into the dusk through one of the upper windows and found its way to freedom when the carpenters were ready to put in the staircase claude telephoned enid and asked her to come and show them just what height she wanted the steps made his mother had always had to climb stairs that were too steep enid stopped her car at the frankfort high school at four oclock and persuaded gladys farmer to drive out with her when they arrived they found claude working on the lattice enclosure of the back porch claude is like jonah enid laughed he wants to plant gourd vines here so they will run over the lattice and make shade i can think of other vines that might be more ornamental claude put down his hammer and said coaxingly have you ever seen a gourd vine when it had something to climb on enid you wouldnt believe how pretty they are big green leaves and gourds and yellow blossoms hanging all over them at the same time an old german woman who keeps a lunch counter at one of those stations on the road to lincoln has them running up her back porch and ive wanted to plant some ever since i first saw hers enid smiled indulgently well i suppose youll let me have clematis for the front porch anyway the men are getting ready to leave so wed better see about the steps after the workmen had gone claude took the girls upstairs by the ladder they emerged from a little entry into a large room which extended over both the front and back parlours the carpenters called it the pool hall there were two long windows like doors opening upon the porch roof and in the sloping ceiling were two dormer windows one looking north to the timber claim and the other south toward lovely creek gladys at once felt a singular pleasantness about this chamber empty and unplastered as it was what a lovely room she exclaimed claude took her up eagerly dont you think so you see its my idea to have the second floor for ourselves instead of cutting it up into little boxes as people usually do we can come up here and forget the farm and the kitchen and all our troubles ive made a big closet for each of us and got everything just right and now enid wants to keep this room for preachers enid laughed not only for preachers claude for gladys when she comes to visit usyou see she likes itand for your mother when she comes to spend a week and rest i dont think we ought to take the best room for ourselves why not claude argued hotly im building the whole house for ourselves come out on the porch roof gladys isnt this fine for hot nights i want to put a railing round and make this into a balcony where we can have chairs and a hammock gladys sat down on the low windowsill enid youd be foolish to keep this for a guest room nobody would ever enjoy it as much as you would you can see the whole country from here enid smiled but showed no sign of relenting lets wait and watch the sun go down be careful claude it makes me nervous to see you lying there he was stretched out on the edge of the roof one leg hanging over and his head pillowed on his arm the flat fields turned red the distant windmills flashed white and little rosy clouds appeared in the sky above them if i make this into a balcony claude murmured the peak of the roof will always throw a shadow over it in the afternoon and at night the stars will be right overhead it will be a fine place to sleep in harvest time oh you could always come up here to sleep on a hot night enid said quickly it wouldnt be the same they sat watching the light die out of the sky and enid and gladys drew close together as the coolness of the autumn evening came on the three friends were thinking about the same thing and yet if by some sorcery each had begun to speak his thoughts aloud amazement and bitterness would have fallen upon all enids reflections were the most blameless the discussion about the guest room had reminded her of brother weldon in september on her way to michigan with mrs royce she had stopped for a day in lincoln to take counsel with arthur weldon as to whether she ought to marry one whom she described to him as an unsaved man young mr weldon approached this subject with a cautious tread but when he learned that the man in question was claude wheeler he became more partisan than was his wont he seemed to think that her marrying claude was the one way to reclaim him and did not hesitate to say that the most important service devout girls could perform for the church was to bring promising young men to its support enid had been almost certain that mr weldon would approve her course before she consulted him but his concurrence always gratified her pride she told him that when she had a home of her own she would expect him to spend a part of his summer vacation there and he blushingly expressed his willingness to do so gladys too was lost in her own thoughts sitting with that ease which made her seem rather indolent her head resting against the empty window frame facing the setting sun the rosy light made her brown eyes gleam like old copper and there was a moody look in them as if in her mind she were defying something when he happened to glance at her it occurred to claude that it was a hard destiny to be the exceptional person in a community to be more gifted or more intelligent than the rest for a girl it must be doubly hard he sat up suddenly and broke the long silence i forgot enid i have a secret to tell you over in the timber claim the other day i started up a flock of quail they must be the only ones left in all this neighbourhood and i doubt if they ever come out of the timber the bluegrass hasnt been mowed in there for yearsnot since i first went away to school and maybe they live on the grass seeds in summer of course there are mulberries enid wondered whether the birds could have learned enough about the world to stay hidden in the timber lot claude was sure they had nobody ever goes near the place except father he stops there sometimes maybe he has seen them and never said a word it would be just like him he told them he had scattered shelled corn in the grass so that the birds would not be tempted to fly over into leonard dawsons cornfield if leonard saw them hed likely take a shot at them why dont you ask him not to enid suggested claude laughed that would be asking a good deal when a bunch of quail rise out of a cornfield theyre a mighty tempting sight if a man likes hunting well have a picnic for you when you come out next summer gladys there are some pretty places over there in the timber gladys started up why its night already its lovely here but you must get me home enid they found it dark inside claude took enid down the ladder and out to her car and then went back for gladys she was sitting on the floor at the top of the ladder giving her his hand he helped her to rise so you like my little house he said gratefully yes oh yes her voice was full of feeling but she did not exert herself to say more claude descended in front of her to keep her from slipping she hung back while he led her through confusing doorways and helped her over the piles of laths that littered the floors at the edge of the gaping cellar entrance she stopped and leaned wearily on his arm for a moment she did not speak but he understood that his new house made her sad that she too had come to the place where she must turn out of the old path he longed to whisper to her and beg her not to marry his brother he lingered and hesitated fumbling in the dark she had his own cursed kind of sensibility she would expect too much from life and be disappointed he was reluctant to lead her out into the chilly evening without some word of entreaty he would willingly have prolonged their passage through many rooms and corridors perhaps had that been possible the strength in him would have found what it was seeking even in this short interval it had stirred and made itself felt had uttered a confused appeal claude was greatly surprised at himself xi enid decided that she would be married in the first week of june early in may the plasterers and painters began to be busy in the new house the walls began to shine and claude went about all day oiling and polishing the hardpine floors and wainscoting he hated to have anybody step on his floors he planted gourd vines about the back porch set out clematis and lilac bushes and put in a kitchen garden he and enid were going to denver and colorado springs for their wedding trip but ralph would be at home then and he had promised to come over and water the flowers and shrubs if the weather was dry enid often brought her work and sat sewing on the front porch while claude was rubbing the woodwork inside the house or digging and planting outside this was the best part of his courtship it seemed to him that he had never spent such happy days before if enid did not come he kept looking down the road and listening went from one thing to another and made no progress he felt full of energy so long as she sat there on the porch with lace and ribbons and muslin in her lap when he passed by going in or out and stopped to be near her for a moment she seemed glad to have him tarry she liked him to admire her needlework and did not hesitate to show him the featherstitching and embroidery she was putting on her new underclothes he could see from the glances they exchanged that the painters thought this very bold behaviour in one so soon to be a bride he thought it very charming behaviour himself though he would never have expected it of enid his heart beat hard when he realized how far she confided in him how little she was afraid of him she would let him linger there standing over her and looking down at her quick fingers or sitting on the ground at her feet gazing at the muslin pinned to her knee until his own sense of propriety told him to get about his work and spare the feelings of the painters when are you going over to the timber claim with me he asked dropping on the ground beside her one warm windy afternoon enid was sitting on the porch floor her back against a pillar and her feet on one of those round mats of pursley that grow over hardbeaten earth ive found my flock of quail again they live in the deep grass over by a ditch that holds water most of the year im going to plant a few rows of peas in there so theyll have a feeding ground at home i consider leonards cornfield a great danger i dont know whether to take him into my confidence or not youve told ernest havel i suppose oh yes claude replied trying not to be aware of the little note of acrimony in her voice hes perfectly safe that place is a paradise for birds the trees are full of nests you can stand over there in the morning and hear the young robins squawking for their breakfast come up early tomorrow morning and go over with me wont you but wear heavy shoes its wet in the long grass while they were talking a sudden whirlwind swept round the corner of the house caught up the little mound of folded lace corsetcovers and strewed them over the dusty yard claude ran after them with enids flowered workbag and thrust them into it as he came upon one after another fluttering in the weeds when he returned enid had folded her needlecase and was putting on her hat thank you she said with a smile did you find everything i think so he hurried toward the car to hide his guilty face one little lace thing he had not put into the bag but had thrust into his pocket the next morning enid came up early to hear the birds in the timber xii on the night before his wedding claude went to bed early he had been dashing about with ralph all day in the car making final preparations and was worn out he fell asleep almost at once the women of the household could not so easily forget the great event of tomorrow after the supper dishes were washed mahailey clambered up to the attic to get the quilt she had so long been saving for a wedding present for claude she took it out of the chest unfolded it and counted the stars in the patterncounting was an accomplishment she was proud ofbefore she wrapped it up it was to go down to the mill house with the other presents tomorrow mrs wheeler went to bed many times that night she kept thinking of things that ought to be looked after getting up and going to make sure that claudes heavy underwear had been put into his trunk against the chance of cold in the mountains or creeping downstairs to see that the six roasted chickens which were to help out at the wedding supper were securely covered from the cats as she went about these tasks she prayed constantly she had not prayed so long and fervently since the battle of the marne early the next morning ralph loaded the big car with the presents and baskets of food and ran down to the royces two motors from town were already standing in the mill yard they had brought a company of girls who came with all the june roses in frankfort to trim the house for the wedding when ralph tooted his horn halfadozen of them ran out to greet him reproaching him because he had not brought his brother along ralph was immediately pressed into service he carried the stepladder wherever he was told drove nails and wound thorny sprays of rambler roses around the pillars between the front and back parlours making the arch under which the ceremony was to take place gladys farmer had not been able to leave her classes at the high school to help in this friendly work but at eleven oclock a livery automobile drove up laden with white and pink peonies from her front yard and bringing a box of hothouse flowers she had ordered for enid from hastings the girls admired them but declared that gladys was extravagant as usual the flowers from her own yard would really have been enough the car was driven by a lank ragged boy who worked about the town garage and who was called silent irv because nobody could ever get a word out of him he had almost no voice at alla thin little squeak in the top of his throat like the gasping whisper of a medium in her trance state when he came to the front door both arms full of peonies he managed to wheeze out these are from miss farmer there are some more down there the girls went back to his car with him and he took out a square box tied up with white ribbons and little silver bells containing the bridal bouquet how did you happen to get these ralph asked the thin boy i was to go to town for them the messenger swallowed miss farmer told me if there were any other flowers at the station marked for here i should bring them along that was nice of her ralph thrust his hand into his trousers pocket how much ill settle with you before i forget a pink flush swept over the boys pale facea delicate face under ragged hair contracted by a kind of shrinking unhappiness his eyes were always halfclosed as if he did not want to see the world around him or to be seen by it he went about like somebody in a dream miss farmer he whispered has paid me well she thinks of everything exclaimed one of the girls you used to go to school to gladys didnt you irv yes mam he got into his car without opening the door slipping like an eel round the steeringrod and drove off the girls followed ralph up the gravel walk toward the house one whispered to the others do you suppose gladys will come out tonight with bayliss wheeler i always thought she had a pretty warm spot in her heart for claude myself some one changed the subject i cant get over hearing irv talk so much gladys must have put a spell on him she was always kind to him in school said the girl who had questioned the silent boy she said he was good in his studies but he was so frightened he could never recite she let him write out the answers at his desk ralph stayed for lunch playing about with the girls until his mother telephoned for him now ill have to go home and look after my brother or hell turn up tonight in a striped shirt give him our love the girls called after him and tell him not to be late as he drove toward the farm ralph met dan taking claudes trunk into town he slowed his car any message he called dan grinned naw i left him doin as well as could be expected mrs wheeler met ralph on the stairs hes up in his room he complains his new shoes are too tight i think its nervousness perhaps hell let you shave him im sure hell cut himself and i wish the barber hadnt cut his hair so short ralph i hate this new fashion of shearing men behind the ears the back of his neck is the ugliest part of a man she spoke with such resentment that ralph broke into a laugh why mother i thought all men looked alike to you anyhow claudes no beauty when will you want your bath ill have to manage so that everybody wont be calling for hot water at once she turned to mr wheeler who sat writing a check at the secretary father could you take your bath now and be out of the way bath mr wheeler shouted i dont want any bath im not going to be married tonight i guess we dont have to boil the whole house for enid ralph snickered and shot upstairs he found claude sitting on the bed with one shoe off and one shoe on a pile of socks lay scattered on the rug a suitcase stood open on one chair and a black travelling bag on another are you sure theyre too small ralph asked about four sizes well why didnt you get them big enough i did that shark in hastings worked off another pair on me when i wasnt looking thats all right snatching away the shoe his brother had picked up to examine i dont care so long as i can stand in them youd better go telephone the depot and ask if the trains on time they wont know yet its seven hours till its due then telephone later but find out somehow i dont want to stand around that station waiting for the train ralph whistled clearly his young man was going to be hard to manage he proposed a bath as a soothing measure no claude had had his bath had he then packed his suitcase how the devil can i pack it when i dont know what im going to put on youll put on one shirt and one pair of socks im going to get some of this stuff out of the way for you ralph caught up a handful of socks and fell to sorting them several had bright red spots on the toe he began to laugh i know why your shoe hurts youve cut your foot claude sprang up as if a hornet had stung him will you get out of here he shouted and let me alone ralph vanished he told his mother he would dress at once as they might have to use force with claude at the last moment the wedding ceremony was to be at eight supper was to follow and claude and enid were to leave frankfort at 1025 on the denver express at six oclock when ralph knocked at his brothers door he found him shaved and brushed and dressed except for his coat his tucked shirt was not rumpled and his tie was properly knotted whatever pain they concealed his patent leather shoes were smooth and glistening and resolutely pointed are you packed ralph asked in astonishment nearly i wish youd go over things and make them look a little neater if you can id hate to have a girl see the inside of that suitcase the way it is where shall i put my cigars theyll make everything smell wherever i put them all my clothes seem to smell of cooking or starch or something i dont know what mahailey does to them he ended bitterly ralph looked outraged well of all ingratitude mahaileys been ironing your damned old shirts for a week yes yes i know dont rattle me i forgot to put any handkerchiefs in my trunk so youll have to get the whole bunch in somewhere mr wheeler appeared in the doorway his sunday black trousers gallowsed up high over a white shirt wafting a rich odor of bayrum from his tumbled hair he held a thin folded paper delicately between his thick fingers where is your billbook son claude caught up his discarded trousers and extracted a square of leather from the pocket his father took it and placed the bit of paper inside with the bank notes you may want to pick up some trifle your wife fancies he said have you got your railroad tickets in here here is your trunk check dan brought back dont forget ive put it in with your tickets and marked it c w so youll know which is your check and which is enids yes sir thank you sir claude had already drawn from the bank all the money he would need this additional bank check was mr wheelers admission that he was sorry for some sarcastic remarks he had made a few days ago when he discovered that claude had reserved a stateroom on the denver express claude had answered curtly that when enid and her mother went to michigan they always had a stateroom and he wasnt going to ask her to travel less comfortably with him at seven oclock the wheeler family set out in the two cars that stood waiting by the windmill mr wheeler drove the big cadillac and ralph took mahailey and dan in the ford when they reached the mill house the outer yard was already black with motors and the porch and parlours were full of people talking and moving about claude went directly upstairs ralph began to seat the guests arranging the folding chairs in such a way as to leave a passage from the foot of the stairs to the floral arch he had constructed that morning the preacher had his bible in his hand and was standing under the light hunting for his chapter enid would have preferred to have mr weldon come down from lincoln to marry her but that would have wounded mr snowberry deeply after all he was her minister though he was not eloquent and persuasive like arthur weldon he had fewer english words at his command than most human beings and even those did not come to him readily in his pulpit he sought for them and struggled with them until drops of perspiration rolled from his forehead and fell upon his coarse matted brown beard but he believed what he said and language was so little an accomplishment with him that he was not tempted to say more than he believed he had been a drummer boy in the civil war on the losing side and he was a simple courageous man ralph was to be both usher and best man gladys farmer could not be one of the bridesmaids because she was to play the wedding march at eight oclock enid and claude came downstairs together conducted by ralph and followed by four girls dressed in white like the bride they took their places under the arch before the preacher he began with the chapter from genesis about the creation of man and adams rib reading in a laboured manner as if he did not quite know why he had selected that passage and was looking for something he did not find his noseglasses kept falling off and dropping upon the open book throughout this prolonged fumbling enid stood calm looking at him respectfully very pretty in her short veil claude was so pale that he looked unnaturalnobody had ever seen him like that before his face between his very black clothes and his smooth sandy hair was white and severe and he uttered his responses in a hollow voice mahailey at the back of the room in a black hat with green gooseberries on it was standing in order to miss nothing she watched mr snowberry as if she hoped to catch some visible sign of the miracle he was performing she always wondered just what it was the preacher did to make the wrongest thing in the world the rightest thing in the world when it was over enid went upstairs to put on her travelling dress and ralph and gladys began seating the guests for supper just twenty minutes later enid came down and took her place beside claude at the head of the long table the company rose and drank the brides health in grapejuice punch mr royce however while the guests were being seated had taken mr wheeler down to the fruit cellar where the two old friends drank off a glass of wellseasoned kentucky whiskey and shook hands when they came back to the table looking younger than when they withdrew the preacher smelled the tang of spirits and felt slighted he looked disconsolately into his ruddy goblet and thought about the marriage at cana he tried to apply his bible literally to life and though he didnt dare breathe it aloud in these days he could never see why he was better than his lord ralph as master of ceremonies kept his head and forgot nothing when it was time to start he tapped claude on the shoulder cutting his father short in one of his best stories contrary to custom the bridal couple were to go to the station unaccompanied and they vanished from the head of the table with only a nod and a smile to the guests ralph hurried them into the light car where he had already stowed enids hand luggage only wizened little mrs royce slipped out from the kitchen to bid them goodbye that evening some bad boys had come out from town and strewn the road near the mill with dozens of broken glass bottles after which they hid in the wild plum bushes to wait for the fun ralphs was the first car out and though his lights glittered on this bed of jagged glass there was no time to stop the road was ditched on either side so he had to drive straight ahead and got into frankfort on flat tires the express whistled just as he pulled up at the station he and claude caught up the four pieces of hand luggage and put them in the stateroom leaving enid there with the bags the two boys went to the rear platform of the observation car to talk until the last moment ralph checked off on his fingers the list of things he had promised claude to attend to claude thanked him feelingly he felt that without ralph he could never have got married at all they had never been such good friends as during the last fortnight the wheels began to turn ralph gripped claudes hand ran to the front of the car and stepped off as claude passed him he stood waving his handkerchiefa rather funny figure under the station lights in his black clothes and his stiff straw hat his short legs well apart wearing his incurably jaunty air the train glided quietly out through the summer darkness along the timbered river valley claude was alone on the back platform smoking a nervous cigar as they passed the deep cut where lovely creek flowed into the river he saw the lights of the mill house flash for a moment in the distance the night air was still heavy with the smell of sweet clover that grew high along the tracks and of wild grapevines wet with dew the conductor came to ask for the tickets saying with a wise smile that he had been hunting for him as he didnt like to trouble the lady after he was gone claude looked at his watch threw away the end of his cigar and went back through the pullman cars the passengers had gone to bed the overhead lights were always turned low when the train left frankfort he made his way through the aisles of swaying green curtains and tapped at the door of his state room it opened a little way and enid stood there in a white silk dressinggown with many ruffles her hair in two smooth braids over her shoulders claude she said in a low voice would you mind getting a berth somewhere out in the car tonight the porter says they are not all taken im not feeling very well i think the dressing on the chicken salad must have been too rich he answered mechanically yes certainly cant i get you something no thank you sleep will do me more good than anything else goodnight she closed the door and he heard the lock slip he stood looking at the highly polished wood of the panel for a moment then turned irresolutely and went back along the slightly swaying aisle of green curtains in the observation car he stretched himself out upon two wicker chairs and lit another cigar at twelve oclock the porter came in this car is closed for the night sah is you the genleman from the stateroom in fourteen do you want a lower no thank you is there a smoking car they is the daycoach smokah but it aint likely very clean at this time o night thats all right its forward claude absently handed him a coin and the porter conducted him to a very dirty car where the floor was littered with newspapers and cigar stumps and the leather cushions were grey with dust a few desperate looking men lay about with their shoes off and their suspenders hanging down their backs the sight of them reminded claude that his left foot was very sore and that his shoes must have been hurting him for some time he pulled them off and thrust his feet in their silk socks on the opposite seat on that long dirty uncomfortable ride claude felt many things but the paramount feeling was homesickness his hurt was of a kind that made him turn with a sort of aching cowardice to the old familiar things that were as sure as the sunrise if only the sagebrush plain over which the stars were shining could suddenly break up and resolve itself into the windings of lovely creek with his fathers house on the hill dark and silent in the summer night when he closed his eyes he could see the light in his mothers window and lower down the glow of mahaileys lamp where she sat nodding and mending his old shirts human love was a wonderful thing he told himself and it was most wonderful where it had least to gain by morning the storm of anger disappointment and humiliation that was boiling in him when he first sat down in the observation car had died out one thing lingered the peculiarly casual indifferent uninterested tone of his wifes voice when she sent him away it was the flat tone in which people make commonplace remarks about common things day broke with silvery brightness on the summer sage the sky grew pink the sand grew gold the dawnwind brought through the windows the acrid smell of the sagebrush an odour that is peculiarly stimulating in the early morning when it always seems to promise freedom large spaces new beginnings better days the train was due in denver at eight oclock exactly at seven thirty claude knocked at enids doorthis time firmly she was dressed and greeted him with a fresh smiling face holding her hat in her hand are you feeling better he asked oh yes i am perfectly all right this morning ive put out all your things for you there on the seat he glanced at them thank you but i wont have time to change im afraid oh wont you im so sorry i forgot to give you your bag last night but you must put on another necktie at least you look too much like a groom do i he asked with a scarcely perceptible curl of his lip everything he needed was neatly arranged on the plush seat shirt collar tie brushes even a handkerchief those in his pockets were black from dusting off the cinders that blew in all night and he threw them down and took up the clean one there was a damp spot on it and as he unfolded it he recognized the scent of a cologne enid often used for some reason this attention unmanned him he felt the smart of tears in his eyes and to hide them bent over the metal basin and began to scrub his face enid stood behind him adjusting her hat in the mirror how terribly smoky you are claude i hope you dont smoke before breakfast no i was in the smoking car awhile i suppose my clothes got full of it you are covered with dust and cinders too she took the clothes broom from the rack and began to brush him claude caught her hand dont please he said sharply the porter can do that for me enid watched him furtively as he closed and strapped his suitcase she had often heard that men were cross before breakfast sure youve forgotten nothing he asked before he closed her bag yes i never lose things on the traindo you sometimes he replied guardedly not looking up as he snapped the catch book three sunrise on the prairie i claude was to continue farming with his father and after he returned from his wedding journey he fell at once to work the harvest was almost as abundant as that of the summer before and he was busy in the fields six days a week one afternoon in august he came home with his team watered and fed the horses in a leisurely way and then entered his house by the back door enid he knew would not be there she had gone to frankfort to a meeting of the antisaloon league the prohibition party was bestirring itself in nebraska that summer confident of voting the state dry the following year which purpose it triumphantly accomplished enids kitchen full of the afternoon sun glittered with new paint spotless linoleum and blueandwhite cooking vessels in the diningroom the cloth was laid and the table was neatly set for one claude opened the icebox where his supper was arranged for him a dish of canned salmon with a white sauce hardboiled eggs peeled and lying in a nest of lettuce leaves a bowl of ripe tomatoes a bit of cold rice pudding cream and butter he placed these things on the table cut some bread and after carelessly washing his face and hands sat down to eat in his working shirt he propped the newspaper against a red glass water pitcher and read the war news while he had his supper he was annoyed when he heard heavy footsteps coming around the house leonard dawson stuck his head in at the kitchen door and claude rose quickly and reached for his hat but leonard came in uninvited and sat down his brown shirt was wet where his suspenders gripped his shoulders and his face under a wide straw hat which he did not remove was unshaven and streaked with dust go ahead and finish your supper he cried having a wife with a car of her own is next thing to having no wife at all how they do like to roll around ive been mighty blamed careful to see that susie never learned to drive a car see here claude how soon do you figure youll be able to let me have the thrasher my wheat will begin to sprout in the shock pretty soon do you reckon your father would be willing to work on sunday if i helped you to let the machine off a day earlier im afraid not mother wouldnt like it we never have done that even when we were crowded well i think ill go over and have a talk with your mother if she could look inside my wheat shocks maybe i could convince her its pretty near a case of your neighbours ox falling into a pit on the sabbath day thats a good idea shes always reasonable leonard rose whats the news the germans have torpedoed an english passenger ship the arabic coming this way too thats all right leonard declared maybe americans will stay at home now and mind their own business i dont care how they chew each other up over there not a bit id as soon one got wiped off the map as another your grandparents were english people werent they thats a long while ago yes my grandmother wore a cap and little white curls and i tell susie i wouldnt mind if the baby turned out to have my grandmothers skin she had the finest complexion i ever saw as they stepped out of the back door a troop of white chickens with red combs ran squawking toward them it was the hour at which the poultry was usually fed leonard stopped to admire them youve got a fine lot of hens i always did like white leghorns where are all your roosters weve only got one hes shut up in the coop the brood hens are setting enid is going to try raising winter frys only one rooster and may i ask what these hens do claude laughed they lay eggs just the samebetter its the fertile eggs that spoil in warm weather this information seemed to make leonard angry i never heard of such damned nonsense he blustered i raise chickens on a natural basis or i dont raise em at all he jumped into his car for fear he would say more when he got home his wife was lifting supper and the baby sat near her in its buggy playing with a rattle dirty and sweaty as he was leonard picked up the clean baby and began to kiss it and smell it rubbing his stubbly chin in the soft creases of its neck the little girl was beside herself with delight go and wash up for supper len susie called from the stove he put down the baby and began splashing in the tin basin talking with his eyes shut susie im in an awful temper i cant stand that damned wife of claudes she was spearing roasting ears out of a big iron pot and looked up through the steam why have you seen her i was listening on the telephone this morning and heard her tell bayliss she would be in town until late oh yes she went to town all right and hes over there eating a cold supper by himself that womans a fanatic she aint content with practising prohibition on humankind shes begun now on the hens while he placed the chairs and wheeled the baby up to the table he explained enids method of raising poultry to his wife she said she really didnt see any harm in it now be honest susie did you ever know hens would keep on laying without a rooster no i didnt but i was brought up the oldfashioned way enid has poultry books and garden books and all such things i dont doubt she gets good ideas from them but anyhow you be careful shes our nearest neighbour and i dont want to have trouble with her ill have to keep out of her way then if she tries to do any missionary work among my chickens ill tell her a few home truths her husbands too bashful to tell her its my opinion shes got that boy cowed already now len you know she wont bother your chickens you keep quiet but claude does seem to sort of avoid people susie admitted filling her husbands plate again mrs joe havel says ernest dont go to claudes any more it seems enid went over there and wanted ernest to paste some prohibition posters about fifteen million drunkards on their barn for an example to the bohemians ernest wouldnt do it and told her he was going to vote for saloons and enid was quite spiteful mrs havel said its too bad when those boys were such chums i used to like to see them together susie spoke so kindly that her husband shot her a quick glance of shy affection do you suppose claude relished having that preacher visiting them when they hadnt been married two months sitting on the front porch in a white necktie every day while claude was out cutting wheat well anyhow i guess claude had more to eat when brother weldon was staying there preachers wont be fed on calories or whatever it is enid calls em said susie who was given to looking on the bright side of things claudes wife keeps a wonderful kitchen but so could i if i never cooked any more than she does leonard gave her a meaning look i dont believe you would live with the sort of man you could feed out of a tin can no i dont believe i would she pushed the buggy toward him take her up daddy she wants to play with you leonard set the baby on his shoulder and carried her off to show her the pigs susie kept laughing to herself as she cleared the table and washed the dishes she was much amused by what her husband had told her late that evening when leonard was starting for the barn to see that all was well before he went to bed he observed a discreet black object rolling along the highroad in the moonlight a red spark winking in the rear he called susie to the door see there she goes going home to report the success of the meeting to claude wouldnt that be a nice way to have your wife coming in now leonard if claude likes it likes it big leonard drew himself up what can he do poor kid hes stung ii after leonard left him claude cleared away the remains of his supper and watered the gourd vine before he went to milk it was not really a gourd vine at all but a summersquash of the crooknecked warty orangecoloured variety and it was now full of ripe squashes hanging by strong stems among the rough green leaves and prickly tendrils claude had watched its rapid growth and the opening of its splotchy yellow blossoms feeling grateful to a thing that did so lustily what it was put there to do he had the same feeling for his little jersey cow which came home every night with full udders and gave down her milk willingly keeping her tail out of his face as only a well disposed cow will do his milking done he sat down on the front porch and lit a cigar while he smoked he did not think about anything but the quiet and the slow cooling of the atmosphere and how good it was to sit still the moon swam up over the bare wheat fields big and magical like a great flower presently he got some bath towels went across the yard to the windmill took off his clothes and stepped into the tin horse tank the water had been warmed by the sun all afternoon and was not much cooler than his body he stretched himself out in it and resting his head on the metal rim lay on his back looking up at the moon the sky was a midnightblue like warm deep blue water and the moon seemed to lie on it like a waterlily floating forward with an invisible current one expected to see its great petals open for some reason claude began to think about the faroff times and countries it had shone upon he never thought of the sun as coming from distant lands or as having taken part in human life in other ages to him the sun rotated about the wheatfields but the moon somehow came out of the historic past and made him think of egypt and the pharaohs babylon and the hanging gardens she seemed particularly to have looked down upon the follies and disappointments of men into the slaves quarters of old times into prison windows and into fortresses where captives languished inside of living people too captives languished yes inside of people who walked and worked in the broad sun there were captives dwelling in darkness never seen from birth to death into those prisons the moon shone and the prisoners crept to the windows and looked out with mournful eyes at the white globe which betrayed no secrets and comprehended all perhaps even in people like mrs royce and his brother bayliss there was something of this sortbut that was a shuddery thought he dismissed it with a quick movement of his hand through the water which disturbed caught the light and played black and gold like something alive over his chest in his own mother the imprisoned spirit was almost more present to people than her corporeal self he had so often felt it when he sat with her on summer nights like this mahailey too had one though the walls of her prison were so thickand gladys farmer oh yes how much gladys must have to tell this perfect confidant the people whose hearts were set high needed such intercoursewhose wish was so beautiful that there were no experiences in this world to satisfy it and these children of the moon with their unappeased longings and futile dreams were a finer race than the children of the sun this conception flooded the boys heart like a second moonrise flowed through him indefinite and strong while he lay deathly still for fear of losing it at last the black cubical object which had caught leonard dawsons wrathful eye came rolling along the highroad claude snatched up his clothes and towels and without waiting to make use of either he ran a white man across a bare white yard gaining the shelter of the house he found his bathrobe and fled to the upper porch where he lay down in the hammock presently he heard his name called pronounced as if it were spelled clod his wife came up the stairs and looked out at him he lay motionless with his eyes closed she went away when all was quiet again he looked off at the still country and the moon in the dark indigo sky his revelation still possessed him making his whole body sensitive like a tightly strung bow in the morning he had forgotten or was ashamed of what had seemed so true and so entirely his own the night before he agreed for the most part that it was better not to think about such things and when he could he avoided thinking iii after the heavy work of harvest was over mrs wheeler often persuaded her husband when he was starting off in his buckboard to take her as far as claudes new house she was glad enid didnt keep her parlour dark as mrs royce kept hers the doors and windows were always open the vines and the long petunias in the windowboxes waved in the breeze and the rooms were full of sunlight and in perfect order enid wore white dresses about her work and white shoes and stockings she managed a house easily and systematically on monday morning claude turned the washing machine before he went to work and by nine oclock the clothes were on the line enid liked to iron and claude had never before in his life worn so many clean shirts or worn them with such satisfaction she told him he need not economize in working shirts it was as easy to iron six as three although within a few months enids car travelled more than two thousand miles for the prohibition cause it could not be said that she neglected her house for reform whether she neglected her husband depended upon ones conception of what was his due when mrs wheeler saw how well their little establishment was conducted how cheerful and attractive enid looked when one happened to drop in there she wondered that claude was not happy and claude himself wondered if his marriage disappointed him in some respects he ought to be a man he told himself and make the best of what was good in it if his wife didnt love him it was because love meant one thing to him and quite another thing to her she was proud of him was glad to see him when he came in from the fields and was solicitous for his comfort everything about a mans embrace was distasteful to enid something inflicted upon women like the pain of childbirth for eves transgression perhaps this repugnance was more than physical she disliked ardour of any kind even religious ardour she had been fonder of claude before she married him than she was now but she hoped for a readjustment perhaps sometime she could like him again in exactly the same way even brother weldon had hinted to her that for the sake of their future tranquillity she must be lenient with the boy and she thought she had been lenient she could not understand his moods of desperate silence the bitter biting remarks he sometimes dropped his evident annoyance if she went over to join him in the timber claim when he lay there idle in the deep grass on a sunday afternoon claude used to lie there and watch the clouds saying to himself its the end of everything for me other men than he must have been disappointed and he wondered how they bore it through a lifetime claude had been a well behaved boy because he was an idealist he had looked forward to being wonderfully happy in love and to deserving his happiness he had never dreamed that it might be otherwise sometimes now when he went out into the fields on a bright summer morning it seemed to him that nature not only smiled but broadly laughed at him he suffered in his pride but even more in his ideals in his vague sense of what was beautiful enid could make his life hideous to him without ever knowing it at such times he hated himself for accepting at all her grudging hospitality he was wronging something in himself in her person enid was still attractive to him he wondered why she had no shades of feeling to correspond to her natural grace and lightness of movement to the gentle almost wistful attitudes of body in which he sometimes surprised her when he came in from work and found her sitting on the porch leaning against a pillar her hands clasped about her knees her head drooping a little he could scarcely believe in the rigidity which met him at every turn was there something repellent in him was it after all his fault enid was rather more indulgent with his father than with any one else he noticed mr wheeler stopped to see her almost every day and even took her driving in his old buckboard bayliss came out from town to spend the evening occasionally enids vegetarian suppers suited him and as she worked with him in the prohibition campaign they always had business to discuss bayliss had a social as well as a hygienic prejudice against alcohol and he hated it less for the harm it did than for the pleasure it gave claude consistently refused to take any part in the activities of the antisaloon league or to distribute what bayliss and enid called our literature in the farming towns the term literature was applied only to a special kind of printed matter there was prohibition literature sexhygiene literature and during a scourge of cattle disease there was hoofandmouth literature this special application of the word didnt bother claude but his mother being an oldfashioned schoolteacher complained about it enid did not understand her husbands indifference to a burning question and could only attribute it to the influence of ernest havel she sometimes asked claude to go with her to one of her committee meetings if it was a sunday he said he was tired and wanted to read the paper if it was a weekday he had something to do at the barn or meant to clear out the timber claim he did indeed saw off a few dead limbs and cut down a tree the lightning had blasted further than that he wouldnt have let anybody clear the timber lot he would have died defending it the timber claim was his refuge in the open grassy spots shut in by the bushy walls of yellowing ash trees he felt unmarried and free free to smoke as much as he liked and to read and dream some of his dreams would have frozen his young wifes blood with horrorand some would have melted his mothers heart with pity to lie in the hot sun and look up at the stainless blue of the autumn sky to hear the dry rustle of the leaves as they fell and the sound of the bold squirrels leaping from branch to branch to lie thus and let his imagination play with lifethat was the best he could do his thoughts he told himself were his own he was no longer a boy he went off into the timber claim to meet a young man more experienced and interesting than himself who had not tied himself up with compromises iv from her upstairs window mrs wheeler could see claude moving back and forth in the west field drilling wheat she felt lonely for him he didnt come home as often as he might she had begun to wonder whether he was one of those people who are always discontented but whatever his disappointments were he kept them locked in his own breast one had to learn the lessons of life nevertheless it made her a little sad to see him so settled and indifferent at twentythree after watching from the window for a few moments she turned to the telephone and called up claudes house asking enid whether she would mind if he came there for dinner mahailey and i get lonesome with mr wheeler away so much she added why no mother wheeler of course not enid spoke cheerfully as she always did have you any one there you can send over to tell him i thought i would walk over myself enid its not far if i take my time mrs wheeler left the house a little before noon and stopped at the creek to rest before she climbed the long hill at the edge of the field she sat down against a grassy bank and waited until the horses came tramping up the long rows claude saw her and pulled them in anything wrong mother he called oh no im going to take you home for dinner with me thats all i telephoned enid he unhooked his team and he and his mother started down the hill together walking behind the horses though they had not been alone like this for a long while she felt it best to talk about impersonal things dont let me forget to give you an article about the execution of that english nurse edith cavell ive read about it he answered listlessly its nothing to be surprised at if they could sink the lusitania they could shoot an english nurse certainly someway i feel as if this were different his mother murmured its like the hanging of john brown i wonder they could find soldiers to execute the sentence oh i guess they have plenty of such soldiers mrs wheeler looked up at him i dont see how we can stay out of it much longer do you i suppose our army wouldnt be a drop in the bucket even if we could get it over they tell us we can be more useful in our agriculture and manufactories than we could by going into the war i only hope it isnt campaign talk i do distrust the democrats claude laughed why mother i guess theres no party politics in this she shook her head ive never yet found a public question in which there wasnt party politics well we can only do our duty as it comes to us and have faith this field finishes your fall work yes ill have time to do some things about the place now im going to make a good icehouse and put up my own ice this winter were you thinking of going up to lincoln for a little i guess not mrs wheeler sighed his tone meant that he had turned his back on old pleasures and old friends have you and enid taken tickets for the lecture course in frankfort i think so mother he answered a little impatiently i told her she could attend to it when she was in town some day of course his mother persevered some of the programs are not very good but we ought to patronize them and make the best of what we have he knew and his mother knew that he was not very good at that his horses stopped at the water tank dont wait for me ill be along in a minute seeing her crestfallen face he smiled never mind mother i can always catch you when you try to give me a pill in a raisin one of us has to be pretty smart to fool the other she blinked up at him with that smile in which her eyes almost disappeared i thought i was smart that time it was a comfort she reflected as she hurried up the hill to get hold of him again to get his attention even while claude was washing for dinner mahailey came to him with a page of newspaper cartoons illustrating german brutality to her they were all photographsshe knew no other way of making a picture mr claude she asked how comes it all them germans is such ugly lookin people the yoeders and the german folks round here aint ugly lookin claude put her off indulgently maybe its the ugly ones that are doing the fighting and the ones at home are nice like our neighbours then why dont they make their soldiers stay home an not go breakin other peoples things an turnin em out of their houses she muttered indignantly they say little babies was born out in the snow last winter an no fires for their mudders nor nothin deed mr claude it wasnt like that in our war the soldiers didnt do nothin to the women an chillun many a time our house was full of northern soldiers an they never so much as broke a piece of my mudders chiney youll have to tell me about it again sometime mahailey i must have my dinner and get back to work if we dont get our wheat in those people over there wont have anything to eat you know the picture papers meant a great deal to mahailey because she could faintly remember the civil war while she pored over photographs of camps and battlefields and devastated villages things came back to her the companies of dusty union infantry that used to stop to drink at her mothers cold mountain spring she had seen them take off their boots and wash their bleeding feet in the run her mother had given one lousebitten boy a clean shirt and she had never forgotten the sight of his back as raw as beef where hed scratched it five of her brothers were in the confederate army when one was wounded in the second battle of bull run her mother had borrowed a wagon and horses gone a three days journey to the field hospital and brought the boy home to the mountain mahailey could remember how her older sisters took turns pouring cold spring water on his gangrenous leg all day and all night there were no doctors left in the neighbourhood and as nobody could amputate the boys leg he died by inches mahailey was the only person in the wheeler household who had ever seen war with her own eyes and she felt that this fact gave her a definite superiority v claude had been married a year and a half one december morning he got a telephone message from his fatherinlaw asking him to come in to frankfort at once he found mr royce sunk in his deskchair smoking as usual with several foreignlooking letters on the table before him as he took these out of their envelopes and sorted the pages claude noticed how unsteady his hands had become one letter from the chief of the medical staff in the mission school where caroline royce taught informed mr royce that his daughter was seriously ill in the mission hospital she would have to be sent to a more salubrious part of the country for rest and treatment and would not be strong enough to return to her duties for a year or more if some member of her family could come out to take care of her it would relieve the school authorities of great anxiety there was also a letter from a fellow teacher and a rather incoherent one from caroline herself after claude finished reading them mr royce pushed a box of cigars toward him and began to talk despondently about missionaries i could go to her he complained but what good would that do im not in sympathy with her ideas and it would only fret her you can see shes made her mind up not to come home i dont believe in one people trying to force their ways or their religion on another im not that kind of man he sat looking at his cigar after a long pause he broke out suddenly china has been drummed into my ears it seems like a long way to go to hunt for trouble dont it a man hasnt got much control over his own life claude if it aint poverty or disease that torments him its a name on the map i could have made out pretty well if it hadnt been for china and some other things if carried had to teach for her clothes and help pay off my notes like old man harrisons daughters like enough shed have stayed at home theres always something i dont know what to say about showing these letters to enid oh she will have to know about it mr royce if she feels that she ought to go to carrie it wouldnt be right for me to interfere mr royce shook his head i dont know it dont seem fair that china should hang over you too when claude got home he remarked as he handed enid the letters your father has been a good deal upset by this i never saw him look so old as he did today enid studied their contents sitting at her orderly little desk while claude pretended to read the paper it seems clear that i am the one to go she said when she had finished you think its necessary for some one to go i dont see it it would look very strange if none of us went enid replied with spirit how look strange why it would look to her associates as if her family had no feeling oh if thats all claude smiled perversely and took up his paper again i wonder how it will look to people here if you go off and leave your husband what a mean thing to say claude she rose sharply then hesitated perplexed people here know me better than that it isnt as if you couldnt be perfectly comfortable at your mothers as he did not glance up from his paper she went into the kitchen claude sat still listening to enids quick movements as she opened up the range to get supper the light in the room grew greyer outside the fields melted into one another as evening came on the young trees in the yard bent and whipped about under a bitter north wind he had often thought with pride that winter died at his front doorstep within no draughty halls no chilly corners this was their second year here when he was driving home the thought that he might be free of this house for a long while had stirred a pleasant excitement in him but now he didnt want to leave it something grew soft in him he wondered whether they couldnt try again and make things go better enid was singing in the kitchen in a subdued rather lonely voice he rose and went out for his milking coat and pail as he passed his wife by the window he stopped and put his arm about her questioningly she looked up thats right youre feeling better about it arent you i thought you would gracious what a smelly coat claude i must find another for you claude knew that tone enid never questioned the rightness of her own decisions when she made up her mind there was no turning her he went down the path to the barn with his hands stuffed in his trousers pockets his bright pail hanging on his arm try againwhat was there to try platitudes littleness falseness his life was choking him and he hadnt the courage to break with it let her go let her go when she would what a hideous world to be born into or was it hideous only for him everything he touched went wrong under his handalways had when they sat down at the supper table in the back parlour an hour later enid looked worn as if this time her decision had cost her something i should think you might have a restful winter at your mothers she began cheerfully you wont have nearly so much to look after as you do here we neednt disturb things in this house i will take the silver down to mother and we can leave everything else just as it is would there be room for my car in your fathers garage you might find it a convenience oh no i wont need it ill put it up at the mill house he answered with an effort at carelessness all the familiar objects that stood about them in the lamplight seemed stiller and more solemn than usual as if they were holding their breath i suppose you had better take the chickens over to your mothers enid continued evenly but i shouldnt like them to get mixed with her plymouth rocks theres not a dark feather among them now do ask mother wheeler to use all the eggs and not to let my hens set in the spring in the spring claude looked up from his plate of course claude i could hardly get back before next fall if im to be of any help to poor carrie i might try to be home for harvest if that would make it more convenient for you she rose to bring in the dessert oh dont hurry on my account he muttered staring after her disappearing figure enid came back with the hot pudding and the afterdinner coffee things this has come on us so suddenly that we must make our plans at once she explained i should think your mother would be glad to keep rose for us she is such a good cow and then you can have all the cream you want he took the little goldrimmed cup she held out to him if you are going to be gone until next fall i shall sell rose he announced gruffly but why you might look a long time before you found another like her i shall sell her anyhow the horses of course are fathers he paid for them if you clear out he may want to rent this place you may find a tenant in here when you get back from china claude swallowed his coffee put down the cup and went into the front parlour where he lit a cigar he walked up and down keeping his eyes fixed upon his wife who still sat at the table in the circle of light from the hanging lamp her head bent forward a little showed the neat part of her brown hair when she was perplexed her face always looked sharper her chin longer if youve no feeling for the place said claude from the other room you can hardly expect me to hang around and take care of it all the time you were campaigning i played housekeeper here enids eyes narrowed but she did not flush claude had never seen a wave of colour come over his wifes pale smooth cheeks dont be childish you know i care for this place its our home but no feeling would be right that kept me from doing my duty you are well and you have your mothers house to go to carrie is ill and among strangers she began to gather up the dishes claude stepped quickly out into the light and confronted her its not only your going you know whats the matter with me its because you want to go you are glad of a chance to get away among all those preachers with their smooth talk and makebelieve enid took up the tray if i am glad its because you are not willing to govern our lives by christian ideals there is something in you that rebels all the time so many important questions have come up since our marriage and you have been indifferent or sarcastic about every one of them you want to lead a purely selfish life she walked resolutely out of the room and shut the door behind her later when she came back claude was not there his hat and coat were gone from the hat rack he must have let himself out quietly by the front door enid sat up until eleven and then went to bed in the morning on coming out from her bedroom she found claude asleep on the lounge dressed with his overcoat on she had a moment of terror and bent over him but she could not detect any smell of spirits she began preparations for breakfast moving quietly having once made up her mind to go out to her sister enid lost no time she engaged passage and cabled the mission school she left frankfort the week before christmas claude and ralph took her as far as denver and put her on a transcontinental express when claude came home he moved over to his mothers and sold his cow and chickens to leonard dawson except when he went to see mr royce he seldom left the farm now and he avoided the neighbours he felt that they were discussing his domestic affairsas of course they were the royces and the wheelers they said couldnt behave like anybody else and it was no use their trying if claude built the best house in the neighbourhood he just naturally wouldnt live in it and if he had a wife at all it was like him to have a wife in china one snowy day when nobody was about claude took the big car and went over to his own place to close the house for the winter and bring away the canned fruit and vegetables left in the cellar enid had packed her best linen in her cedar chest and had put the kitchen and china closets in scrupulous order before she went away he began covering the upholstered chairs and the mattresses with sheets rolled up the rugs and fastened the windows securely as he worked his hands grew more and more numb and listless and his heart was like a lump of ice all these things that he had selected with care and in which he had taken such pride were no more to him now than the lumber piled in the shop of any secondhand dealer how inherently mournful and ugly such objects were when the feeling that had made them precious no longer existed the debris of human life was more worthless and ugly than the dead and decaying things in nature rubbish junk his mind could not picture anything that so exposed and condemned all the dreary weary everrepeated actions by which life is continued from day to day actions without meaning as he looked out and saw the grey landscape through the gently falling snow he could not help thinking how much better it would be if people could go to sleep like the fields could be blanketed down under the snow to wake with their hurts healed and their defeats forgotten he wondered how he was to go on through the years ahead of him unless he could get rid of this sick feeling in his soul at last he locked the door put the key in his pocket and went over to the timber claim to smoke a cigar and say goodbye to the place there he soberly walked about for more than an hour under the crooked trees with empty birds nests in their forks every time he came to a break in the hedge he could see the little house giving itself up so meekly to solitude he did not believe that he would ever live there again well at any rate the money his father had put into the place would not be lost he could always get a better tenant for having a comfortable house there several of the boys in the neighbourhood were planning to be married within the year the future of the house was safe and he he stopped short in his walk his feet had made an uncertain purposeless trail all over the white ground it vexed him to see his own footsteps what was itwhat was the matter with him why at least could he not stop feeling things and hoping what was there to hope for now he heard a sound of distress and looking back saw the barn cat that had been left behind to pick up her living she was standing inside the hedge her jet black fur ruffled against the wet flakes one paw lifted mewing miserably claude went over and picked her up whats the matter blackie mice getting scarce in the barn mahailey will say you are bad luck maybe you are but you cant help it can you he slipped her into his overcoat pocket later when he was getting into his car he tried to dislodge her and put her in a basket but she clung to her nest in his pocket and dug her claws into the lining he laughed well if you are bad luck i guess you are going to stay right with me she looked up at him with startled yellow eyes and did not even mew vi mrs wheeler was afraid that claude might not find the old place comfortable after having had a house of his own she put her best rocking chair and a reading lamp in his bedroom he often sat there all evening shading his eyes with his hand pretending to read when he stayed downstairs after supper his mother and mahailey were grateful besides collecting war pictures mahailey now hunted through the old magazines in the attic for pictures of china she had marked on her big kitchen calendar the day when enid would arrive in hongkong mr claude she would say as she stood at the sink washing the supper dishes its broad daylight over where miss enid is aint it cause the worlds round an the old sun hes ashinin over there for the yaller people from time to time when they were working together mrs wheeler told mahailey what she knew about the customs of the chinese the old woman had never had two impersonal interests at the same time before and she scarcely knew what to do with them she would murmur on half to claude and half to herself they aint fightin over there where miss enid is is they an she wont have to wear their kind of clothes cause shes a white woman she wont let em kill their girl babies nor do such awful things like they always have an she wont let em pray to them stone iboles cause they cant help em none i spect miss enidll do a heap of good all the time behind her diplomatic monologues however mahailey had her own ideas and she was greatly scandalized at enids departure she was afraid people would say that claudes wife had run off an lef him and in the virginia mountains where her social standards had been formed a husband or wife thus deserted was the object of boisterous ridicule she once stopped mrs wheeler in a dark corner of the cellar to whisper mr claudes wife aint goin to stay off there like her sister is she if one of the yoeder boys or susie dawson happened to be at the wheelers for dinner mahailey never failed to refer to enid in a loud voice mr claudes wife she cuts her potatoes up raw in the pan an fries em she dont boil em first like i do i know shes an awful good cook i know she is she felt that easy references to the absent wife made things look better ernest havel came to see claude now but not often they both felt it would be indelicate to renew their former intimacy ernest still felt aggrieved about his beer as if enid had snatched the tankard from his lips with her own corrective hand like leonard he believed that claude had made a bad bargain in matrimony but instead of feeling sorry for him ernest wanted to see him convinced and punished when he married enid claude had been false to liberal principles and it was only right that he should pay for his apostasy the very first time he came to spend an evening at the wheelers after claude came home to live ernest undertook to explain his objections to prohibition claude shrugged his shoulders why not drop it its a matter that doesnt interest me one way or the other ernest was offended and did not come back for nearly a monthnot indeed until the announcement that germany would resume unrestricted submarine warfare made every one look questioningly at his neighbour he walked into the wheelers kitchen the night after this news reached the farming country and found claude and his mother sitting at the table reading the papers aloud to each other in snatches ernest had scarcely taken a seat when the telephone bell rang claude answered the call its the telegraph operator at frankfort he said as he hung up the receiver he repeated a message from father sent from wray will be home day after tomorrow read the papers what does he mean what does he suppose we are doing it means he considers our situation very serious its not like him to telegraph except in case of illness mrs wheeler rose and walked distractedly to the telephone box as if it might further disclose her husbands state of mind but what a queer message it was addressed to you too mother not to me he would know how i feel about it some of your fathers people were seagoing men out of portsmouth he knows what it means when our shipping is told where it can go on the ocean and where it cannot it isnt possible that washington can take such an affront for us to think that at this time of all times we should have a democratic administration claude laughed sit down mother wait a day or two give them time the war will be over before washington can do anything mrs wheeler ernest declared gloomily england will be starved out and france will be beaten to a standstill the whole german army will be on the western front now what could this country do how long do you suppose it takes to make an army mrs wheeler stopped short in her restless pacing and met his moody glance i dont know anything ernest but i believe the bible i believe that in the twinkling of an eye we shall be changed ernest looked at the floor he respected faith as he said you must respect it or despise it for there was nothing else to do claude sat leaning his elbows on the table it always comes back to the same thing mother even if a raw army could do anything how would we get it over there heres one naval authority who says the germans are turning out submarines at the rate of three a day they probably didnt spring this on us until they had enough built to keep the ocean clear i dont pretend to say what we could accomplish son but we must stand somewhere morally they have told us all along that we could be more helpful to the allies out of the war than in it because we could send munitions and supplies if we agree to withdraw that aid where are we helping germany all the time we are pretending to mind our own business if our only alternative is to be at the bottom of the sea we had better be there mother do sit down we cant settle it tonight i never saw you so worked up your father is worked up too or he would never have sent that telegram mrs wheeler reluctantly took up her workbasket and the boys talked with their old easy friendliness when ernest left claude walked as far as the yoeders place with him and came back across the snowdrifted fields under the frosty brilliance of the winter stars as he looked up at them he felt more than ever that they must have something to do with the fate of nations and with the incomprehensible things that were happening in the world in the ordered universe there must be some mind that read the riddle of this one unhappy planet that knew what was forming in the dark eclipse of this hour a question hung in the air over all this quiet land about him over him over his mother even he was afraid for his country as he had been that night on the state house steps in denver when this war was undreamed of hidden in the womb of time claude and his mother had not long to wait three days later they knew that the german ambassador had been dismissed and the american ambassador recalled from berlin to older men these events were subjects to think and converse about but to boys like claude they were life and death predestination vii one stormy morning claude was driving the big wagon to town to get a load of lumber the roads were beginning to thaw out and the country was black and dirty looking here and there on the dark mud grey snow crusts lingered perforated like honeycomb with wet weedstalks sticking up through them as the wagon creaked over the high ground just above frankfort claude noticed a brilliant new flag flying from the schoolhouse cupola he had never seen the flag before when it meant anything but the fourth of july or a political rally today it was as if he saw it for the first time no bands no noise no orators a spot of restless colour against the sodden march sky he turned out of his way in order to pass the high school drew up his team and waited a few minutes until the noon bell rang the older boys and girls came out first with a flurry of raincoats and umbrellas presently he saw gladys farmer in a yellow slicker and an oilskin hat and waved to her she came up to the wagon i like your decoration he said glancing toward the cupola its a silk one the senior boys bought with their athletic money i advised them not to run it up in this rain but the class president told me they bought that flag for storms get in and ill take you home she took his extended hand put her foot on the hub of the wheel and climbed to the seat beside him he clucked to his team so your high school boys are feeling warlike these days very what do you think i think theyll have a chance to express their feelings do you claude it seems awfully unreal nothing else seems very real either im going to haul out a load of lumber but i never expect to drive a nail in it these things dont matter now there is only one thing we ought to do and only one thing that matters we all know it you feel its coming nearer every day every day gladys made no reply she only looked at him gravely with her calm generous brown eyes they stopped before the low house where the windows were full of flowers she took his hand and swung herself to the ground holding it for a moment while she said goodbye claude drove back to the lumber yard in a place like frankfort a boy whose wife was in china could hardly go to see gladys without causing gossip viii during the bleak month of march mr wheeler went to town in his buckboard almost every day for the first time in his life he had a secret anxiety the one member of his family who had never given him the slightest trouble his son bayliss was just now under a cloud bayliss was a pacifist and kept telling people that if only the united states would stay out of this war and gather up what europe was wasting she would soon be in actual possession of the capital of the world there was a kind of logic in bayliss utterances that shook nat wheelers imperturbable assumption that one point of view was as good as another when bayliss fought the dram and the cigarette wheeler only laughed that a son of his should turn out a prohibitionist was a joke he could appreciate but bayliss attitude in the present crisis disturbed him day after day he sat about his sons place of business interrupting his arguments with funny stories bayliss did not go home at all that month he said to his father no mothers too violent id better not claude and his mother read the papers in the evening but they talked so little about what they read that mahailey inquired anxiously whether they werent still fighting over yonder when she could get claude alone for a moment she pulled out sunday supplement pictures of the devastated countries and asked him to tell her what was to become of this family photographed among the ruins of their home of this old woman who sat by the roadside with her bundles wheres she goin to anyways see mr claude shes got her iron cookpot pore old thing carryin it all the way pictures of soldiers in gasmasks puzzled her gas was something she hadnt learned about in the civil war so she worked it out for herself that these masks were worn by the army cooks to protect their eyes when they were cutting up onions all them onions they have to cut up it would put their eyes out if they didnt wear somethin she argued on the morning of the eighth of april claude came downstairs early and began to clean his boots which were caked with dry mud mahailey was squatting down beside her stove blowing and puffing into it the fire was always slow to start in heavy weather claude got an old knife and a brush and putting his foot on a chair over by the west window began to scrape his shoe he had said goodmorning to mahailey nothing more he hadnt slept well and was pale mr claude mahailey grumbled this stove aint never drawed good like my old one mr ralph took away from me i cant do nothin with it maybe youll clean it out for me next sunday ill clean it today if you say so i wont be here next sunday im going away something in his tone made mahailey get up her eyes still blinking with the smoke and look at him sharply you aint goin off there where miss enid is she asked anxiously no mahailey he had dropped the shoebrush and stood with one foot on the chair his elbow on his knee looking out of the window as if he had forgotten himself no im not going to china im going over to help fight the germans he was still staring out at the wet fields before he could stop her before he knew what she was doing she had caught and kissed his unworthy hand i knowed you would she sobbed i always knowed you would you nice boy you old mahail knowed her upturned face was working all over her mouth her eyebrows even the wrinkles on her low forehead were working and twitching claude felt a tightening in his throat as he tenderly regarded that face behind the pale eyes under the low brow where there was not room for many thoughts an idea was struggling and tormenting her the same idea that had been tormenting him youre all right mahailey he muttered patting her back and turning away now hurry breakfast you aint told your mudder yit she whispered no not yet but shell be all right too he caught up his cap and went down to the barn to look after the horses when claude returned the family were already at the breakfast table he slipped into his seat and watched his mother while she drank her first cup of coffee then he addressed his father father i dont see any use of waiting for the draft if you can spare me id like to get into a training camp somewhere i believe id stand a chance of getting a commission i shouldnt wonder mr wheeler poured maple syrup on his pancakes with a liberal hand how do you feel about it evangeline mrs wheeler had quietly put down her knife and fork she looked at her husband in vague alarm while her fingers moved restlessly about over the tablecloth i thought claude went on hastily that maybe i would go up to omaha tomorrow and find out where the training camps are to be located and have a talk with the men in charge of the enlistment station of course he added lightly they may not want me i havent an idea what the requirements are no i dont understand much about it either mr wheeler rolled his top pancake and conveyed it to his mouth after a moment of mastication he said you figure on going tomorrow id like to i wont bother with baggagesome shirts and underclothes in my suitcase if the government wants me it will clothe me mr wheeler pushed back his plate well now i guess youd better come out with me and look at the wheat i dont know but id best plough up that south quarter and put it in corn i dont believe it will make anything much when claude and his father went out of the door dan sprang up with more alacrity than usual and plunged after them he did not want to be left alone with mrs wheeler she remained sitting at the foot of the deserted breakfast table she was not crying her eyes were utterly sightless her back was so stooped that she seemed to be bending under a burden mahailey cleared the dishes away quietly out in the muddy fields claude finished his talk with his father he explained that he wanted to slip away without saying goodbye to any one i have a way you know he said flushing of beginning things and not getting very far with them i dont want anything said about this until im sure i may be rejected for one reason or another mr wheeler smiled i guess not however ill tell dan to keep his mouth shut will you just go over to leonard dawsons and get that wrench he borrowed its about noon and hell likely be at home claude found big leonard watering his team at the windmill when leonard asked him what he thought of the presidents message he blurted out at once that he was going to omaha to enlist leonard reached up and pulled the lever that controlled the almost motionless wheel better wait a few weeks and ill go with you im going to try for the marines they take my eye claude standing on the edge of the tank almost fell backward why whatwhat for leonard looked him over good lord claude you aint the only fellow around here that wears pants what for well ill tell you what for he held up three large red fingers threateningly belgium the lusitania edith cavell that dirts got under my skin ill get my corn planted and then fatherll look after susie till i come back claude took a long breath well leonard you fooled me i believed all this chaff youve been giving me about not caring who chewed up who and no more do i care leonard protested not a damn but theres a limit ive been ready to go since the lusitania i dont get any satisfaction out of my place any more susie feels the same way claude looked at his big neighbour well im off tomorrow leonard dont mention it to my folks but if i cant get into the army im going to enlist in the navy theyll always take an ablebodied man im not coming back here he held out his hand and leonard took it with a smack good luck claude maybe well meet in foreign parts wouldnt that be a joke give my love to enid when you write i always did think she was a fine girl though i disagreed with her on prohibition claude crossed the fields mechanically without looking where he went his power of vision was turned inward upon scenes and events wholly imaginary as yet ix one bright june day mr wheeler parked his car in a line of motors before the new pressedbrick court house in frankfort the court house stood in an open square surrounded by a grove of cottonwoods the lawn was freshly cut and the flower beds were blooming when mr wheeler entered the courtroom upstairs it was already halffull of farmers and townspeople talking in low tones while the summer flies buzzed in and out of the open windows the judge a onearmed man with white hair and sidewhiskers sat at his desk writing with his left hand he was an old settler in frankfort county but from his frockcoat and courtly manners you might have thought he had come from kentucky yesterday instead of thirty years ago he was to hear this morning a charge of disloyalty brought against two german farmers one of the accused was august yoeder the wheelers nearest neighbour and the other was troilus oberlies a rich german from the northern part of the county oberlies owned a beautiful farm and lived in a big white house set on a hill with a fine orchard rows of beehives barns granaries and poultry yards he raised turkeys and tumblerpigeons and many geese and ducks swam about on his cattleponds he used to boast that he had six sons like our german emperor his neighbours were proud of his place and pointed it out to strangers they told how oberlies had come to frankfort county a poor man and had made his fortune by his industry and intelligence he had twice crossed the ocean to revisit his fatherland and when he returned to his home on the prairies he brought presents for every one his lawyer his banker and the merchants with whom he dealt in frankfort and vicount each of his neighbours had in his parlour some piece of woodcarving or weaving or some ingenious mechanical toy that oberlies had picked up in germany he was an older man than yoeder wore a short beard that was white and curly like his hair and though he was low in stature his puffy red face and full blue eyes and a certain swagger about his carriage gave him a look of importance he was boastful and quicktempered but until the war broke out in europe nobody had ever had any trouble with him since then he had constantly found fault and complainedeverything was better in the old country mr wheeler had come to town prepared to lend yoeder a hand if he needed one they had worked adjoining fields for thirty years now he was surprised that his neighbour had got into trouble he was not a blusterer like oberlies but a big quiet man with a serious largefeatured face and a stern mouth that seldom opened his countenance might have been cut out of red sandstone it was so heavy and fixed he and oberlies sat on two wooden chairs outside the railing of the judges desk presently the judge stopped writing and said he would hear the charges against troilus oberlies several neighbours took the stand in succession their complaints were confused and almost humorous oberlies had said the united states would be licked and that would be a good thing america was a great country but it was run by fools and to be governed by germany was the best thing that could happen to it the witness went on to say that since oberlies had made his money in this country here the judge interrupted him please confine yourself to statements which you consider disloyal made in your presence by the defendant while the witness proceeded the judge took off his glasses and laid them on the desk and began to polish the lenses with a silk handkerchief trying them and rubbing them again as if he desired to see clearly a second witness had heard oberlies say he hoped the german submarines would sink a few troopships that would frighten the americans and teach them to stay at home and mind their own business a third complained that on sunday afternoons the old man sat on his front porch and played die wacht am rhein on a slidetrombone to the great annoyance of his neighbours here nat wheeler slapped his knee with a loud guffaw and a titter ran through the courtroom the defendants puffy red cheeks seemed fashioned by his maker to give voice to that piercing instrument when asked if he had anything to say to these charges the old man rose threw back his shoulders and cast a defiant glance at the courtroom you may take my property and imprison me but i explain nothing and i take back nothing he declared in a loud voice the judge regarded his inkwell with a smile you mistake the nature of this occasion mr oberlies you are not asked to recant you are merely asked to desist from further disloyal utterances as much for your own protection and comfort as from consideration for the feelings of your neighbours i will now hear the charges against mr yoeder mr yoeder a witness declared had said he hoped the united states would go to hell now that it had been bought over by england when the witness had remarked to him that if the kaiser were shot it would end the war yoeder replied that charity begins at home and he wished somebody would put a bullet in the president when he was called upon yoeder rose and stood like a rock before the judge i have nothing to say the charges are true i thought this was a country where a man could speak his mind yes a man can speak his mind but even here he must take the consequences sit down please the judge leaned back in his chair and looking at the two men in front of him began with deliberation mr oberlies and mr yoeder you both know and your friends and neighbours know why you are here you have not recognized the element of appropriateness which must be regarded in nearly all the transactions of life many of our civil laws are founded upon it you have allowed a sentiment noble in itself to carry you away and lead you to make extravagant statements which i am confident neither of you mean no man can demand that you cease from loving the country of your birth but while you enjoy the benefits of this country you should not defame its government to extol another you both admit to utterances which i can only adjudge disloyal i shall fine you each three hundred dollars a very light fine under the circumstances if i should have occasion to fix a penalty a second time it will be much more severe after the case was concluded mr wheeler joined his neighbour at the door and they went downstairs together well what do you hear from claude mr yoeder asked hes still at fort r he expects to get home on leave before he sails gus youll have to lend me one of your boys to cultivate my corn the weeds are getting away from me yes you can have any of my boystill the draft gets em said yoeder sourly i wouldnt worry about it a little military training is good for a boy you fellows know that mr wheeler winked and yoeders grim mouth twitched at one corner that evening at supper mr wheeler gave his wife a full account of the court hearing so that she could write it to claude mrs wheeler always more a schoolteacher than a housekeeper wrote a rapid easy hand and her long letters to claude reported all the neighbourhood doings mr wheeler furnished much of the material for them like many longmarried men he had fallen into the way of withholding neighbourhood news from his wife but since claude went away he reported to her everything in which he thought the boy would be interested as she laconically said in one of her letters your father talks a great deal more at home than formerly and sometimes i think he is trying to take your place x on the first day of july claude wheeler found himself in the fast train from omaha going home for a weeks leave the uniform was still an unfamiliar sight in july 1917 the first draft was not yet called and the boys who had rushed off and enlisted were in training camps far away therefore a redheaded young man with long straight legs in puttees and broad energetic responsiblelooking shoulders in closefitting khaki made a conspicuous figure among the passengers little boys and young girls peered at him over the tops of seats men stopped in the aisle to talk to him old ladies put on their glasses and studied his clothes his bulky canvas holdall and even the book he kept opening and forgetting to read the country that rushed by him on each side of the track was more interesting to his trained eye than the pages of any book he was glad to be going through it at harvestthe season when it is most itself he noted that there was more corn than usualmuch of the winter wheat had been weather killed and the fields were ploughed up in the spring and replanted in maize the pastures were already burned brown the alfalfa was coming green again after its first cutting binders and harvesters were abroad in the wheat and oats gathering the softbreathing billows of grain into wide subduing arms when the train slowed down for a trestle in a wheat field harvesters in blue shirts and overalls and wide straw hats stopped working to wave at the passengers claude turned to the old man in the opposite seat when i see those fellows i feel as if id wakened up in the wrong clothes his neighbour looked pleased and smiled that the kind of uniform youre accustomed to i surely never wore anything else in the month of july claude admitted when i find myself riding along in a train in the middle of harvest trying to learn french verbs then i know the world is turned upside down for a fact the old man pressed a cigar upon him and began to question him like the hero of the odyssey upon his homeward journey claude had often to tell what his country was and who were the parents that begot him he was constantly interrupted in his perusal of a french phrasebook made up of sentences chosen for their usefulness to soldierssuch as non jamais je ne regarde les femmes by the questions of curious strangers presently he gathered up his luggage shook hands with his neighbour and put on his hatthe same old stetson with a gold cord and two hard tassels added to its conical severity i get off at this station and wait for the freight that goes down to frankfort the cottontail we call it the old man wished him a pleasant visit home and the best of luck in days to come every one in the car smiled at him as he stepped down to the platform with his suitcase in one hand and his canvas bag in the other his old friend mrs voigt the german woman stood out in front of her restaurant ringing her bell to announce that dinner was ready for travellers a crowd of young boys stood about her on the sidewalk laughing and shouting in disagreeable jeering tones as claude approached one of them snatched the bell from her hand ran off across the tracks with it and plunged into a cornfield the other boys followed and one of them shouted dont go in there to eat soldier shes a german spy and shell put ground glass in your dinner claude swept into the lunch room and threw his bags on the floor whats the matter mrs voigt can i do anything for you she was sitting on one of her own stools crying piteously her false frizzes awry looking up she gave a little screech of recognition oh i tank gott it was you and no more trouble coming you know i aint no spy nor nodding like what dem boys say dem young fellers is dreadful rough mit me i sell dem candy since dey was babies an now dey turn on me like dis hindenburg dey calls me and kaiser bill she began to cry again twisting her stumpy little fingers as if she would tear them off give me some dinner maam and then ill go and settle with that gang ive been away for a long time and it seemed like getting home when i got off the train and saw your squaw vines running over the porch like they used to ya you remember dat she wiped her eyes i got a potpie today and green peas chust a few out of my own garden bring them along please we dont get anything but canned stuff in camp some railroad men came in for lunch mrs voigt beckoned claude off to the end of the counter where after she had served her customers she sat down and talked to him in whispers my you look good in dem clothes she said patting his sleeve i can remember some wars too when we got back dem provinces what napoleon took away from us alsace and lorraine dem boys is passed de word to come and put tar on me some night and i am skeered to go in my bet i chust wrap in a quilt and sit in my old chair dont pay any attention to them you dont have trouble with the business people here do you noo not troubles exactly she hesitated then leaned impulsively across the counter and spoke in his ear but it aint all so bad in de old country like what dey say de poor people aint slaves and dey aint ground down like what dey say here always de forester let de poor folks come into de wood and carry off de limbs dat fall and de dead trees und if de rich farmer have maybe a liddle more manure dan he need he let de poor man come and take some for his land de poor folks dont git such wages like here but dey lives chust as comfortable und dem wooden shoes what dey makes such fun of is cleaner dan what leather is to go round in de mud and manure dey dont git so wet and dey dont stink so claude could see that her heart was bursting with homesickness full of tender memories of the faraway time and land of her youth she had never talked to him of these things before but now she poured out a flood of confidences about the big dairy farm on which she had worked as a girl how she took care of nine cows and how the cows though small were very strongdrew a plough all day and yet gave as much milk at night as if they had been browsing in a pasture the country people never had to spend money for doctors but cured all diseases with roots and herbs and when the old folks had the rheumatism they took one of dem liddle jennypigs to bed with them and the guineapig drew out all the pain claude would have liked to listen longer but he wanted to find the old womans tormentors before his train came in leaving his bags with her he crossed the railroad tracks guided by an occasional teasing tinkle of the bell in the cornfield presently he came upon the gang a dozen or more lying in a shallow draw that ran from the edge of the field out into an open pasture he stood on the edge of the bank and looked down at them while he slowly cut off the end of a cigar and lit it the boys grinned at him trying to appear indifferent and at ease looking for any one soldier asked the one with the bell yes i am im looking for that bell youll have to take it back where it belongs you every one of you know theres no harm in that old woman shes a german and were fighting the germans aint we i dont think youll ever fight any youd last about ten minutes in the american army youre not our kind theres only one army in the world that wants men wholl bully old women you might get a job with them the boys giggled claude beckoned impatiently come along with that bell kid the boy rose slowly and climbed the bank out of the gully as they tramped back through the cornfield claude turned to him abruptly see here arent you ashamed of yourself oh i dont know about that the boy replied airily tossing the bell up like a ball and catching it well you ought to be i didnt expect to see anything of this kind until i got to the front ill be back here in a week and ill make it hot for anybody thats been bothering her claudes train was pulling in and he ran for his baggage once seated in the cottontail he began going down into his own country where he knew every farm he passedknew the land even when he did not know the owner what sort of crops it yielded and about how much it was worth he did not recognize these farms with the pleasure he had anticipated because he was so angry about the indignities mrs voigt had suffered he was still burning with the first ardour of the enlisted man he believed that he was going abroad with an expeditionary force that would make war without rage with uncompromising generosity and chivalry most of his friends at camp shared his quixotic ideas they had come together from farms and shops and mills and mines boys from college and boys from tough joints in big cities sheepherders street car drivers plumbers assistants billiard markers claude had seen hundreds of them when they first came in show men in cheap loud sport suits ranch boys in knitted waistcoats machinists with the grease still on their fingers farmhands like dan in their one sunday coat some of them carried paper suitcases tied up with rope some brought all they had in a blue handkerchief but they all came to give and not to ask and what they offered was just themselves their big red hands their strong backs the steady honest modest look in their eyes sometimes when he had helped the medical examiner claude had noticed the anxious expression in the faces of the long lines of waiting men they seemed to say if im good enough take me ill stay by he found them like that to work with serviceable goodnatured and eager to learn if they talked about the war or the enemy they were getting ready to fight it was usually in a facetious tone they were going to can the kaiser or to make the crown prince work for a living claude loved the men he trained withwouldnt choose to live in any better company the freight train swung into the river valley that meant homethe place the mind always came back to after its farthest quest rapidly the farms passed the haystacks the cornfields the familiar red barnsthen the long coal sheds and the water tank and the train stopped on the platform he saw ralph and mr royce waiting to welcome him over there in the automobile were his father and mother mr wheeler in the drivers seat a line of motors stood along the siding he was the first soldier who had come home and some of the townspeople had driven down to see him arrive in his uniform from one car susie dawson waved to him and from another gladys farmer while he stopped and spoke to them ralph took his bags come along boys mr wheeler called tooting his horn and he hurried the soldier away leaving only a cloud of dust behind mr royce went over to old man dawsons car and said rather childishly it cant be that claudes grown taller i suppose its the way they learn to carry themselves he always was a manly looking boy i expect his mothers a proud woman said susie very much excited its too bad enid cant be here to see him she would never have gone away if shed known all that was to happen susie did not mean this as a thrust but it took effect mr royce turned away and lit a cigar with some difficulty his hands had grown very unsteady this last year though he insisted that his general health was as good as ever as he grew older he was more depressed by the conviction that his womenfolk had added little to the warmth and comfort of the world women ought to do that whatever else they did he felt apologetic toward the wheelers and toward his old friends it seemed as if his daughters had no heart xi camp habits persisted on his first morning at home claude came downstairs before even mahailey was stirring and went out to have a look at the stock the red sun came up just as he was going down the hill toward the cattle corral and he had the pleasant feeling of being at home on his fathers land why was it so gratifying to be able to say our hill and our creek down yonder to feel the crunch of this particular dried mud under his boots when he went into the barn to see the horses the first creatures to meet his eye were the two big mules that had run away with him standing in the stalls next the door it flashed upon claude that these muscular quadrupeds were the actual authors of his fate if they had not bolted with him and thrown him into the wire fence that morning enid would not have felt sorry for him and come to see him every day and his life might have turned out differently perhaps if older people were a little more honest and a boy were not taught to idealize in women the very qualities which can make him utterly unhappybut there he had got away from those regrets but wasnt it just like him to be dragged into matrimony by a pair of mules he laughed as he looked at them you old devils youre strong enough to play such tricks on green fellows for years to come youre chock full of meanness one of the animals wagged an ear and cleared his throat threateningly mules are capable of strong affections but they hate snobs are the enemies of caste and this pair had always seemed to detect in claude what his father used to call his false pride when he was a young lad they had been a source of humiliation to him braying and balking in public places trying to show off at the lumber yard or in front of the post office at the end manger claude found old molly the grey mare with the stiff leg who had grown a second hoof on her off forefoot an achievement not many horses could boast of he was sure she recognized him she nosed his hand and arm and turned back her upper lip showing her worn yellow teeth mustnt do that molly he said as he stroked her a dog can laugh but it makes a horse look foolish seems to me dan might curry you about once a week he took a comb from its niche behind a joist and gave her old coat a rubbing her white hair was flecked all over with little rustcoloured dashes like india ink put on with a fine brush and her mane and tail had turned a greenish yellow she must be eighteen years old claude reckoned as he polished off her round heavy haunches he and ralph used to ride her over to the yoeders when they were barefoot youngsters guiding her with a rope halter and kicking at the leggy colt that was always running alongside when he entered the kitchen and asked mahailey for warm water to wash his hands she sniffed him disapprovingly why mr claude youve been curryin that old mare and youve got white hairs all over your soldierclothes youre jist covered if his uniform stirred feeling in people of sober judgment over mahailey it cast a spell she was so dazzled by it that all the time claude was at home she never once managed to examine it in detail before she got past his puttees her powers of observation were befogged by excitement and her wits began to jump about like monkeys in a cage she had expected his uniform to be blue like those she remembered and when he walked into the kitchen last night she scarcely knew what to make of him after mrs wheeler explained to her that american soldiers didnt wear blue now mahailey repeated to herself that these brown clothes didnt show the dust and that claude would never look like the bedraggled men who used to stop to drink at her mothers spring them leather leggins is to keep the briars from scratchin you aint they i spect theres an awful lot of briars over there like them long blackberry vines in the fields in virginia your madder says the soldiers git lice now like they done in our war you jist carry a little bottle of coaloil in your pocket an rub it on your head at night it keeps the nits from hatchin over the flour barrel in the corner mahailey had tacked a red cross poster a charcoal drawing of an old woman poking with a stick in a pile of plaster and twisted timbers that had once been her home claude went over to look at it while he dried his hands where did you get your picture shes over there where youre goin mr claude there she is huntin for somethin to cook with no stove nor no dishes nor nothineverything all broke up i reckon shell be mighty glad to see you comin heavy footsteps sounded on the stairs and mahailey whispered hastily dont forgit about the coaloil and dont you be lousy if you can help it honey she considered lice in the same class with smutty jokesthings to be whispered about after breakfast mr wheeler took claude out to the fields where ralph was directing the harvesters they watched the binder for a while then went over to look at the haystacks and alfalfa and walked along the edge of the cornfield where they examined the young ears mr wheeler explained and exhibited the farm to claude as if he were a stranger the boy had a curious feeling of being now formally introduced to these acres on which he had worked every summer since he was big enough to carry water to the harvesters his father told him how much land they owned and how much it was worth and that it was unencumbered except for a trifling mortgage he had given on one quarter when he took over the colorado ranch when you come back he said you and ralph wont have to hunt around to get into business youll both be well fixed now youd better go home by old man dawsons and drop in to see susie everybody about here was astonished when leonard went he walked with claude to the corner where the dawson land met his own by the way he said as he turned back dont forget to go in to see the yoeders sometime gus is pretty sore since they had him up in court ask for the old grandmother you remember she never learned any english and now theyve told her its dangerous to talk german she dont talk at all and hides away from everybody if i go by early in the morning when shes out weeding the garden she runs and squats down in the gooseberry bushes till im out of sight claude decided he would go to the yoeders today and to the dawsons tomorrow he didnt like to think there might be hard feeling toward him in a house where he had had so many good times and where he had often found a refuge when things were dull at home the yoeder boys had a musicbox long before the days of victrolas and a magic lantern and the old grandmother made wonderful shadowpictures on a sheet and told stories about them she used to turn the map of europe upside down on the kitchen table and showed the children how in this position it looked like a jungfrau and recited a long german rhyme which told how spain was the maidens head the pyrenees her lace ruff germany her heart and bosom england and italy were two arms and russia though it looked so big was only a hoopskirt this rhyme would probably be condemned as dangerous propaganda now as he walked on alone claude was thinking how this country that had once seemed little and dull to him now seemed large and rich in variety during the months in camp he had been wholly absorbed in new work and new friendships and now his own neighbourhood came to him with the freshness of things that have been forgotten for a long whilecame together before his eyes as a harmonious whole he was going away and he would carry the whole countryside in his mind meaning more to him than it ever had before there was lovely creek gurgling on down there where he and ernest used to sit and lament that the book of history was finished that the world had come to avaricious old age and noble enterprise was dead for ever but he was going away that afternoon claude spent with his mother it was the first time she had had him to herself ralph wanted terribly to stay and hear his brother talk but understanding how his mother felt he went back to the wheat field there was no detail of claudes life in camp so trivial that mrs wheeler did not want to hear about it she asked about the mess the cooks the laundry as well as about his own duties she made him describe the bayonet drill and explain the operation of machine guns and automatic rifles i hardly see how we can bear the anxiety when our transports begin to sail she said thoughtfully if they can once get you all over there i am not afraid i believe our boys are as good as any in the world but with submarines reported off our own coast i wonder how the government can get our men across safely the thought of transports going down with thousands of young men on board is something so terrible she put her hands quickly over her eyes claude sitting opposite his mother wondered what it was about her hands that made them so different from any others he had ever seen he had always known they were different but now he must look closely and see why they were slender and always white even when the nails were stained at preserving time her fingers arched back at the joints as if they were shrinking from contacts they were restless and when she talked often brushed her hair or her dress lightly when she was excited she sometimes put her hand to her throat or felt about the neck of her gown as if she were searching for a forgotten brooch they were sensitive hands and yet they seemed to have nothing to do with sense to be almost like the groping fingers of a spirit how do you boys feel about it claude started about what mother oh the transportation we dont worry about that its the governments job to get us across a soldier mustnt worry about anything except what hes directly responsible for if the germans should sink a few troop ships it would be unfortunate certainly but it wouldnt cut any figure in the long run the british are perfecting an enormous dirigible built to carry passengers if our transports are sunk it will only mean delay in another year the yankees will be flying over they cant stop us mrs wheeler bent forward that must be boys talk claude surely you dont believe such a thing could be practicable absolutely the british are depending on their aircraft designers to do just that if everything else fails of course nobody knows yet how effective the submarines will be in our case mrs wheeler again shaded her eyes with her hand when i was young back in vermont i used to wish that i had lived in the old times when the world went ahead by leaps and bounds and now i feel as if my sight couldnt bear the glory that beats upon it it seems as if we would have to be born with new faculties to comprehend what is going on in the air and under the sea xii the afternoon sun was pouring in at the back windows of mrs farmers long uneven parlour making the dusky room look like a cavern with a fire at one end of it the furniture was all in its cool figured summer cretonnes the glass flower vases that stood about on little tables caught the sunlight and twinkled like tiny lamps claude had been sitting there for a long while and he knew he ought to go through the window at his elbow he could see rows of double hollyhocks the flat leaves of the sprawling catalpa and the spires of the tangled mint bed all transparent in the goldpowdered light they had talked about everything but the thing he had come to say as he looked out into the garden he felt that he would never get it out there was something in the way the mint bed burned and floated that made one a fatalistafraid to meddle but after he was far away he would regret uncertainty would tease him like a splinter in his thumb he rose suddenly and said without apology gladys i wish i could feel sure youd never marry my brother she did not reply but sat in her easy chair looking up at him with a strange kind of calmness i know all the advantages he went on hastily but they wouldnt make it up to you that sort of acompromise would make you awfully unhappy i know i dont think i shall ever marry bayliss gladys spoke in her usual low round voice but her quick breathing showed he had touched something that hurt i suppose i have used him it gives a schoolteacher a certain prestige if people think she can marry the rich bachelor of the town whenever she wants to but i am afraid i wont marry himbecause you are the member of the family i have always admired claude turned away to the window a fine lot ive been to admire he muttered well its true anyway it was like that when we went to high school and its kept up everything you do always seems exciting to me claude felt a cold perspiration on his forehead he wished now that he had never come but thats it gladys what have i ever done except make one blunder after another she came over to the window and stood beside him i dont know perhaps its by their blunders that one gets to know peopleby what they cant do if youd been like all the rest you could have got on in their way that was the one thing i couldnt have stood claude was frowning out into the flaming garden he had not heard a word of her reply why didnt you keep me from making a fool of myself he asked in a low voice i think i triedonce anyhow its all turning out better than i thought you didnt get stuck here youve found your place youre sailing away youve just begun and what about you she laughed softly oh i shall teach in the high school claude took her hands and they stood looking searchingly at each other in the swimming golden light that made everything transparent he never knew exactly how he found his hat and made his way out of the house he was only sure that gladys did not accompany him to the door he glanced back once and saw her head against the bright window she stood there exactly where he left her and watched the evening come on not moving scarcely breathing she was thinking how often when she came downstairs she would see him standing here by the window or moving about in the dusky room looking at last as he ought to looklike his convictions and the choice he had made she would never let this house be sold for taxes now she would save her salary and pay them off she could never like any other room so well as this it had always been a refuge from frankfort and now there would be this vivid confident figure an image as distinct to her as the portrait of her grandfather upon the wall xiii sunday was claudes last day at home and he took a long walk with ernest and ralph ernest would have preferred to lose ralph but when the boy was out of the harvest field he stuck to his brother like a burr there was something about claudes new clothes and new manner that fascinated him and he went through one of those sudden changes of feeling that often occur in families although they had been better friends ever since claudes wedding until now ralph had always felt a little ashamed of him why he used to ask himself wouldnt claude spruce up and be somebody now he was struck by the fact that he was somebody on monday morning mrs wheeler wakened early with a faintness in her chest this was the day on which she must acquit herself well breakfast would be claudes last meal at home at eleven oclock his father and ralph would take him to frankfort to catch the train she was longer than usual in dressing when she got downstairs claude and mahailey were already talking he was shaving in the washroom and mahailey stood watching him a side of bacon in her hand you tell em over there im awful sorry about them old women with their dishes an their stove all broke up all right i will claude scraped away at his chin she lingered maybe you can help em mend their things like you do mine fur me she suggested hopefully maybe he murmured absently mrs wheeler opened the stair door and mahailey dodged back to the stove after breakfast dan went out to the fields with the harvesters ralph and claude and mr wheeler were busy with the car all morning mrs wheeler kept throwing her apron over her head and going down the hill to see what they were doing whether there was really something the matter with the engine or whether the men merely made it a pretext for being together and keeping away from the house she did not know she felt that her presence was not much desired and at last she went upstairs and resignedly watched them from the sittingroom window presently she heard ralph run up to the third storey when he came down with claudes bags in his hands he stuck his head in at the door and shouted cheerfully to his mother no hurry im just taking them down so theyll be ready mrs wheeler ran after him calling faintly wait ralph are you sure hes got everything in i didnt hear him packing everything ready he says he wont have to go upstairs again hell be along pretty soon theres lots of time ralph shot down through the basement mrs wheeler sat down in her reading chair they wanted to keep her away and it was a little selfish of them why couldnt they spend these last hours quietly in the house instead of dashing in and out to frighten her now she could hear the hot water running in the kitchen probably mr wheeler had come in to wash his hands she felt really too weak to get up and go to the west window to see if he were still down at the garage waiting was now a matter of seconds and her breath came short enough as it was she recognized a heavy hobnailed boot on the stairs mounting quickly when claude entered carrying his hat in his hand she saw by his walk his shoulders and the way he held his head that the moment had come and that he meant to make it short she rose reaching toward him as he came up to her and caught her in his arms she was smiling her little curious intimate smile with halfclosed eyes well is it goodbye she murmured she passed her hands over his shoulders down his strong back and the closefitting sides of his coat as if she were taking the mould and measure of his mortal frame her chin came just to his breast pocket and she rubbed it against the heavy cloth claude stood looking down at her without speaking a word suddenly his arms tightened and he almost crushed her mother he whispered as he kissed her he ran downstairs and out of the house without looking back she struggled up from the chair where she had sunk and crept to the window he was vaulting down the hill as fast as he could go he jumped into the car beside his father ralph was already at the wheel and claude had scarcely touched the cushions when they were off they ran down the creek and over the bridge then up the long hill on the other side as they neared the crest of the hill claude stood up in the car and looked back at the house waving his coneshaped hat she leaned out and strained her sight but her tears blurred everything the brown upright figure seemed to float out of the car and across the fields and before he was actually gone she lost him she fell back against the windowsill clutching her temples with both hands and broke into choking passionate speech old eyes she cried why do you betray me why do you cheat me of my last sight of my splendid son book four the voyage of the anchises i a long train of crowded cars the passengers all of the same sex almost of the same age all dressed and hatted alike was slowly steaming through the green seameadows late on a summer afternoon in the cars incessant stretching of cramped legs shifting of shoulders striking of matches passing of cigarettes groans of boredom occasionally concerted laughter about nothing suddenly the train stops short clipped heads and tanned faces pop out at every window the boys begin to moan and shout what is the matter now the conductor goes through the cars saying something about a freight wreck on ahead he has orders to wait here for half an hour nobody pays any attention to him a murmur of astonishment rises from one side of the train the boys crowd over to the south windows at last there is something to look atthough what they see is so strangely quiet that their own exclamations are not very loud their train is lying beside an arm of the sea that reaches far into the green shore at the edge of the still water stand the hulls of four wooden ships in the process of building there is no town there are no smokestacksvery few workmen piles of lumber lie about on the grass a gasoline engine under a temporary shelter is operating a long crane that reaches down among the piles of boards and beams lifts a load silently and deliberately swings it over to one of the skeleton vessels and lowers it somewhere into the body of the motionless thing along the sides of the clean hulls a few riveters are at work they sit on suspended planks lowering and raising themselves with pulleys like house painters only by listening very closely can one hear the tap of their hammers no orders are shouted no thud of heavy machinery or scream of iron drills tears the air these strange boats seem to be building themselves some of the men got out of the cars and ran along the tracks asking each other how boats could be built off in the grass like this lieutenant claude wheeler stretched his legs upon the opposite seat and sat still at his window looking down on this strange scene shipbuilding he had supposed meant noise and forges and engines and hosts of men this was like a dream nothing but green meadows soft grey water a floating haze of mist a little rosy from the sinking sun spectrelike seagulls flying slowly with the red glow tinging their wingsand those four hulls lying in their braces facing the sea deliberating by the sea claude knew nothing of ships or shipbuilding but these craft did not seem to be nailed togetherthey seemed all of a piece like sculpture they reminded him of the houses not made with hands they were like simple and great thoughts like purposes forming slowly here in the silence beside an unruffled arm of the atlantic he knew nothing about ships but he didnt have to the shape of those hullstheir strong inevitable linestold their story was their story told the whole adventure of man with the sea wooden ships when great passions and great aspirations stirred a country shapes like these formed along its shores to be the sheath of its valour nothing claude had ever seen or heard or read or thought had made it all so clear as these untried wooden bottoms they were the very impulse they were the potential act they were the going over the drawn arrow the great unuttered cry they were fate they were tomorrow the locomotive screeched to her scattered passengers like an old turkeyhen calling her brood the soldier boys came running back along the embankment and leaped aboard the train the conductor shouted they would be in hoboken in time for supper ii it was midnight when the men had got their supper and began unrolling their blankets to sleep on the floor of the long dock waitingroomswhich in other days had been thronged by people who came to welcome homecoming friends or to bid them godspeed to foreign shores claude and some of his men had tried to look about them but there was little to be seen the bow of a boat painted in distracting patterns of black and white rose at one end of the shed but the water itself was not visible down in the cobblepaved street below they watched for awhile the long line of drays and motor trucks that bumped all night into a vast cavern lit by electricity where crates and barrels and merchandise of all kinds were piled marked american expeditionary forces cases of electrical machinery from some factory in ohio parts of automobiles guncarriages bathtubs hospital supplies bales of cotton cases of canned food grey metal tanks full of chemical fluids claude went back to the waiting room lay down and fell asleep with the glare of an arclight shining full in his face he was called at four in the morning and told where to report to headquarters captain maxey stationed at a desk on one of the landings explained to his lieutenants that their company was to sail at eight oclock on the anchises it was an english boat an old liner pulled off the australian trade that could carry only twentyfive hundred men the crew was english but part of the storesthe meat and fresh fruit and vegetableswere furnished by the united states government the captain had been over the boat during the night and didnt like it very well he had expected to be scheduled for one of the fine big hamburgamerican liners with diningrooms finished in rosewood and ventilation plants and cooling plants and elevators running from top to bottom like a new york office building however he said well have to make the best of it theyre using everything thats got a bottom now the company formed for rollcall at one end of the shed with their packs and rifles breakfast was served to them while they waited after an hours standing on the concrete they saw encouraging signs two gangplanks were lowered from the vessel at the end of the slip and up each of them began to stream a close brown line of men in smart service caps they recognized a company of kansas infantry and began to grumble because their own service caps hadnt yet been given to them they would have to sail in their old stetsons soon they were drawn into one of the brown lines that went continuously up the gangways like belting running over machinery on the deck one steward directed the men down to the hold and another conducted the officers to their cabins claude was shown to a fourberth stateroom one of his cabin mates lieutenant fanning of his own company was already there putting his slender luggage in order the steward told them the officers were breakfasting in the dining saloon by seven oclock all the troops were aboard and the men were allowed on deck for the first time claude saw the profile of new york city rising thin and gray against an opalcoloured morning sky the day had come on hot and misty the sun though it was now high was a red ball streaked across with purple clouds the tall buildings of which he had heard so much looked unsubstantial and illusionarymere shadows of grey and pink and blue that might dissolve with the mist and fade away in it the boys were disappointed they were western men accustomed to the hard light of high altitudes and they wanted to see the city clearly they couldnt make anything of these uneven towers that rose dimly through the vapour everybody was asking questions which of those pale giants was the singer building which the woolworth what was the gold dome dully glinting through the fog nobody knew they agreed it was a shame they could not have had a day in new york before they sailed away from it and that they would feel foolish in paris when they had to admit they had never so much as walked up broadway tugs and ferry boats and coal barges were moving up and down the oily river all novel sights to the men over in the canard and french docks they saw the first examples of the camouflage they had heard so much about big vessels daubed over in crazy patterns that made the eyes ache some in black and white some in soft rainbow colours a tug steamed up alongside and fastened a few moments later a man appeared on the bridge and began to talk to the captain young fanning who had stuck to claudes side told him this was the pilot and that his arrival meant they were going to start they could see the shiny instruments of a band assembling in the bow lets get on the other side near the rail if we can said fanning the fellows are bunching up over here because they want to look at the goddess of liberty as we go out they dont even know this boat turns around the minute she gets into the river they think shes going over stern first it was not easy to cross the deck every inch was covered by a boot the whole superstructure was coated with brown uniforms they clung to the boat davits the winches the railings and ventilators like bees in a swarm just as the vessel was backing out a breeze sprang up and cleared the air blue sky broke overhead and the pale silhouette of buildings on the long island grew sharp and hard windows flashed flamecoloured in their grey sides the gold and bronze tops of towers began to gleam where the sunlight struggled through the transport was sliding down toward the point and to the left the eye caught the silver cobweb of bridges seen confusingly against each other there she is hello old girl goodbye sweetheart the swarm surged to starboard they shouted and gesticulated to the image they were all looking forso much nearer than they had expected to see her clad in green folds with the mist streaming up like smoke behind for nearly every one of those twentyfive hundred boys as for claude it was their first glimpse of the bartholdi statue though she was such a definite image in their minds they had not imagined her in her setting of sea and sky with the shipping of the world coming and going at her feet and the moving cloud masses behind her postcard pictures had given them no idea of the energy of her large gesture or how her heaviness becomes light among the vapourish elements france gave her to us they kept saying as they saluted her before claude had got over his first thrill the kansas band in the bow began playing over there two thousand voices took it up booming out over the water the gay indomitable resolution of that jaunty air a staten island ferryboat passed close under the bow of the transport the passengers were officegoing people on their way to work and when they looked up and saw these hundreds of faces all young all bronzed and grinning they began to shout and wave their handkerchiefs one of the passengers was an old clergyman a famous speaker in his day now retired who went over to the city every morning to write editorials for a church paper he closed the book he was reading stood by the rail and taking off his hat began solemnly to quote from a poet who in his time was still popular sail on he quavered thou too sail on o ship of state humanity with all its fears with all its hopes of future years is hanging breathless on thy fate as the troop ship glided down the sea lane the old man still watched it from the turtleback that howling swarm of brown arms and hats and faces looked like nothing but a crowd of american boys going to a football game somewhere but the scene was ageless youths were sailing away to die for an idea a sentiment for the mere sound of a phrase and on their departure they were making vows to a bronze image in the sea iii all the first morning tod fanning showed claude over the boatnot that fanning had ever been on anything bigger than a lake michigan steamer but he knew a good deal about machinery and did not hesitate to ask the deck stewards to explain anything he didnt know the stewards indeed all the crew struck the boys as an unusually goodnatured and obliging set of men the fourth occupant of number 96 claudes cabin had not turned up by noon nor had any of his belongings so the three who had settled their few effects there began to hope they would have the place to themselves it would be crowded enough at that the third bunk was assigned to an officer from the kansas regiment lieutenant bird a virginian who had been working in his uncles bank in topeka when he enlisted he and claude sat together at mess when they were at lunch the virginian said in his very gentle voice lieutenant i wish youd explain lieutenant fanning to me he seems very immature hes been telling me about a submarine destroyer hes invented but it looks to me like foolishness claude laughed dont try to understand fanning just let him sink in and youll come to like him i used to wonder how he ever got a commission you never can tell what crazy thing hell do fanning had for instance brought on board a pair of white flannel pants his first and only tailormade trousers because he had a premonition that the boat would make a port and that he would be asked to a garden party he had a way of using big words in the wrong place not because he tried to show off but because all words sounded alike to him in the first days of their acquaintance in camp he told claude that this was a failing he couldnt help and that it was called anaesthesia sometimes this failing was confusing when fanning sententiously declared that he would like to be on hand when the crown prince settled his little account with plato claude was perplexed until subsequent witticisms revealed that the boy meant pluto at three oclock there was a band concert on deck claude fell into talk with the bandmaster and was delighted to find that he came from hillport kansas a town where claude had once been with his father to buy cattle and that all his fourteen men came from hillport they were the town band had enlisted in a body had gone into training together and had never been separated one was a printer who helped to get out the hillport argus every week another clerked in a grocery store another was the son of a german watch repairer one was still in high school one worked in an automobile livery after supper claude found them all together very much interested in their first evening at sea and arguing as to whether the sunset on the water was as fine as those they saw every night in hillport they hung together in a quiet determined way and if you began to talk to one you soon found that all the others were there when claude and fanning and lieutenant bird were undressing in their narrow quarters that night the fourth berth was still unclaimed they were in their bunks and almost asleep when the missing man came in and unceremoniously turned on the light they were astonished to see that he wore the uniform of the royal flying corps and carried a cane he seemed very young but the three who peeped out at him felt that he must be a person of consequence he took off his coat with the spread wings on the collar wound his watch and brushed his teeth with an air of special personal importance soon after he had turned out the light and climbed into the berth over lieutenant bird a heavy smell of rum spread in the close air fanning who slept under claude kicked the sagging mattress above him and stuck his head out hullo wheeler what have you got up there nothing nothing smells pretty good to me ill have some with anybody that asks me no response from any quarter bird the virginian murmured dont make a row and they went to sleep in the morning when the bath steward came he edged his way into the narrow cabin and poked his head into the berth over birds im sorry sir ive made careful search for your luggage and its not to be found sir i tell you it must be found fumed a petulant voice overhead i brought it over from the st regis myself in a taxi i saw it standing on the pier with the officers luggagea black cabin trunk with vm lettered on both ends get after it the steward smiled discreetly he probably knew that the aviator had come on board in a state which precluded any very accurate observation on his part very well sir is there anything i can get you for the present you can take this shirt out and have it laundered and bring it back to me tonight ive no linen in my bag yes sir claude and fanning got on deck as quickly as possible and found scores of their comrades already there pointing to dark smudges of smoke along the clear horizon they knew that these vessels had come from unknown ports some of them far away steaming thither under orders known only to their commanders they would all arrive within a few hours of each other at a given spot on the surface of the ocean there they would fall into place flanked by their destroyers and would proceed in orderly formation without changing their relative positions their escort would not leave them until they were joined by gunboats and destroyers off whatever coast they were bound forwhat that coast was not even their own officers knew as yet later in the morning this meeting was actually accomplished there were ten troop ships some of them very large boats and six destroyers the men stood about the whole morning gazing spellbound at their sister transports trying to find out their names guessing at their capacity tanned as they already were their lips and noses began to blister under the fiery sunlight after long months of intensive training the sudden drop into an idle soothing existence was grateful to them though their pasts were neither long or varied most of them like claude wheeler felt a sense of relief at being rid of all they had ever been before and facing something absolutely new said tod fanning as he lounged against the rail whoever likes it can run for a train every morning and grind his days out in a westinghouse works but not for me any more the virginian joined them that englishman aint got out of bed yet i reckon hes been liquouring up pretty steady the place smells like a bar the room steward was just coming out and he winked at me he was slipping something in his pocket looked like a banknote claude was curious and went down to the cabin as he entered the airman lying halfdressed in his upper berth raised himself on one elbow and looked down at him his blue eyes were contracted and hard his curly hair disordered but his cheeks were as pink as a girls and the little yellow hummingbird moustache on his upper lip was twisted sharp youre missing fine weather said claude affably oh therell be a great deal of weather before we get over and damned little of anything else he drew a bottle from under his pillow have a nip i dont mind if i do claude put out his hand the other laughed and sank back on his pillow drawling lazily brave boy go ahead drink to the kaiser why to him in particular its not particular drink to hindenburg or the high command or anything else that got you out of the cornfield thats where they did get you didnt they well its a good guess anyhow where did they get you crystal lake iowa i think that was the place he yawned and folded his hands over his stomach why we thought you were an englishman not quite ive served in his majestys army two years though have you been flying in france yes ive been back and forth all the time england and france now ive wasted two months at fort worth instructor thats not my line i may have been sent over as a reprimand you cant tell about my colonel though may have been his way of getting me out of danger claude glanced up at him shocked at such an idea the young man in the berth smiled with listless compassion oh i dont mean bosch planes there are dangers and dangers youll find you got bloody little information about this war where they trained you they dont communicate any details of importance going claude hadnt intended to but at this suggestion he pulled back the door one moment called the aviator cant you keep that longlegged ass who bunks under you quiet fanning hes a good kid whats the matter with him his general ignorance and his insufferably familiar tone snapped the other as he turned over claude found fanning and the virginian playing checkers and told them that the mysterious airman was a fellow countryman both seemed disappointed pshaw exclaimed lieutenant bird he cant put on airs with me after that fanning declared crystal lake why its no town at all all the same claude wanted to find out how a youth from crystal lake ever became a member of the royal flying corps already from among the hundreds of strangers halfadozen stood out as men he was determined to know better taking them altogether the men were a fine sight as they lounged about the decks in the sunlight the petty rivalries and jealousies of camp days forgotten their youth seemed to flow together like their brown uniforms seen in the mass like this claude thought they were rather noble looking fellows in so many of the faces there was a look of fine candour an expression of cheerful expectancy and confident goodwill there was on board a solitary marine with the stripes of border service on his coat he had been sick in the navy hospital in brooklyn when his regiment sailed and was now going over to join it he was a young fellow rather pale from his recent illness but he was exactly claudes idea of what a soldier ought to look like his eye followed the marine about all day the young mans name was albert usher and he came from a little town up in the wind river mountains in wyoming where he had worked in a logging camp he told claude these facts when they found themselves standing side by side that evening watching the broad purple sun go down into a violet coloured sea it was the hour when the farmers at home drive their teams in after the days work claude was thinking how his mother would be standing at the west window every evening now watching the sun go down and following him in her mind when the young marine came up and joined him he confessed to a pang of homesickness thats a kind of sickness i dont have to wrastle with said albert usher i was left an orphan on a lonesome ranch when i was nine and ive looked out for myself ever since claude glanced sidewise at the boys handsome head that came up from his neck with clean strong lines and thought he had done a pretty good job for himself he could not have said exactly what it was he liked about young ushers face but it seemed to him a face that had gone through thingsthat had been trained down like his body and had developed a definite character what claude thought due to a manly adventurous life was really due to wellshaped bones ushers face was more modelled than most of the healthy countenances about him when questioned the marine went on to say that though he had no home of his own he had always happened to fall on his feet among kind people he could go back to any house in pinedale or du bois and be welcomed like a son i suppose there are kind women everywhere he said but in that respect wyomings got the rest of the world beat i never felt the lack of a home now the u s marines are my family wherever they are im at home were you at vera cruz claude asked i guess we thought that was quite a little party at the time but i suppose it will seem small potatoes when we get over there im figuring on seeing some firstrate scrapping how long have you been in the army year ago last april ive had hard luck about getting over they kept me jumping about to train men then yours is all to come are you a college graduate no i went away to school but i didnt finish usher frowned at the gilded path on the water where the sun lay half submerged like a big watchful eye closing i always wanted to go to college but i never managed it a man in laramie offered to stake me to a course in the university there but i was too restless i guess i was ashamed of my handwriting he paused as if he had run against some old regret a moment later he said suddenly can you parlezvous no i know a few words but i cant put them together same here i expect to pick up some i pinched quite a little spanish down on the border by this time the sun had disappeared and all over the west the yellow sky came down evenly like a gold curtain on the still sea that seemed to have solidified into a slab of dark blue stonenot a twinkle on its immobile surface across its dusky smoothness were two long smears of pale green like a robins egg do you like the water usher asked in the tone of a polite host when i first shipped on a cruiser i was crazy about it i still am but you know i like them old bald mountains back in wyoming too theres waterfalls you can see twenty miles off from the plains they look like white sheets or something hanging up there on the cliffs and down in the pine woods in the cold streams theres trout as long as my forearm that evening claude was on deck almost alone there was a concert down in the ward room to the west heavy clouds had come up moving so low that they flapped over the water like a black washing hanging on the line the music sounded well from below four swedish boys from the scandinavian settlement at lindsborg kansas were singing long long ago claude listened from a sheltered spot in the stern what were they and what was he doing here on the atlantic two years ago he had seemed a fellow for whom life was over driven into the ground like a post or like those chinese criminals who are planted upright in the earth with only their heads left out for birds to peck at and insects to sting all his comrades had been tucked away in prairie towns with their little jobs and their little plans yet here they were attended by unknown ships called in from the four quarters of the earth how had they come to be worth the watchfulness and devotion of so many men and machines this extravagant consumption of fuel and energy taken one by one they were ordinary fellows like himself yet here they were and in this massing and movement of men there was nothing mean or common he was sure of that it was from first to last unforeseen almost incredible four years ago when the french were holding the marne the wisest men in the world had not conceived of this as possible they had reckoned with every fortuity but this out of these stones can my father raise up seed unto abraham downstairs the men began singing annie laurie where were those summer evenings when he used to sit dumb by the windmill wondering what to do with his life iv the morning of the third day claude and the virginian and the marine were up very early standing in the bow watching the anchises mount the fresh blowing hills of water her prow as it rose and fell always a dull triangle against the glitter their escorts looked like dream ships soft and iridescent as shell in the pearlcoloured tints of the morning only the dark smudges of smoke told that they were mechanical realities with stokers and engines while the three stood there a sergeant brought claude word that two of his men would have to report at sickcall corporal tannhauser had had such an attack of nosebleed during the night that the sergeant thought he might die before they got it stopped tannhauser was up now and in the breakfast line but the sergeant was sure he ought not to be this fritz tannhauser was the tallest man in the company a germanamerican boy who when asked his name usually said that his name was dennis and that he was of irish descent even this morning he tried to joke and pointing to his big red face told claude he thought he had measles only they aint german measles lieutenant he insisted medical inspection took a long while that morning there seemed to be an outbreak of sickness on board when claude brought his two men up to the doctor he told them to go below and get into bed as they left he turned to claude give them hot tea and pile army blankets on them make them sweat if you can claude remarked that the hold wasnt a very cheerful place for sick men i know that lieutenant but there are a number of sick men this morning and the only other physician on board is the sickest of the lot theres the ships doctor of course but hes only responsible for the crew and so far he doesnt seem interested ive got to overhaul the hospital and the medical stores this morning is there an epidemic of some sort well i hope not but ill have plenty to do today so i count on you to look after those two the doctor was a new englander who had joined them at hoboken he was a brisk trim man with piercing eyes cleancut features and grey hair just the colour of his pale face claude felt at once that he knew his business and he went below to carry out instructions as well as he could when he came up from the hold he saw the aviatorwhose name he had learned was victor morsesmoking by the rail this cabinmate still piqued his curiosity first time youve been up isnt it the aviator was looking at the distant smoke plumes over the quivering bright water time enough i wish i knew where we are heading for it will be awfully awkward for me if we make a french port i thought you said you were to report in france i am but i want to report in london first he continued to gaze off at the painted ships claude noticed that in standing he held his chin very high his eyes now that he was quite sober were brilliantly young and daring they seemed scornful of things about him he held himself conspicuously apart as if he were not among his own kind claude had seen a captured crane tied by its leg to a hencoop behave exactly like that among mahaileys chickens hold its wings to its sides and move its head about quickly and glare i suppose you have friends in london he asked rather the aviator replied with feeling do you like it better than paris i shouldnt imagine anything was much better than london ive not been in paris always went home when i was on leave they work us pretty hard in the infantry and artillery our men get only a fortnight off in twelve months i understand the americans have leased the rivierarecuperate at nice and monte carlo the only cooks tour we had was gallipoli he added grimly victor had gone a good way toward acquiring an english accent the boys thought at least he said necessry and dysentry and called his suspenders braces he offered claude a cigarette remarking that his cigars were in his lost trunk take one of mine my brother sent me two boxes just before we sailed ill put a box in your bunk next time i go down theyre good ones the young man turned and looked him over with surprise i say thats very decent of you yes thank you i will claude had tried yesterday when he lent victor some shirts to make him talk about his aerial adventures but upon that subject he was as close as a clam he admitted that the long red scar on his upper arm had been drilled by a sharpshooter from a german fokker but added hurriedly that it was of no consequence as he had made a good landing now on the strength of the cigars claude thought he would probe a little further he asked whether there was anything in the lost trunk that couldnt be replaced anything valuable theres one thing thats positively invaluable a zeiss lens in perfect condition ive got several good photographic outfits from time to time but the lenses are always cracked by heatthe things usually come down on fire this one i got out of a plane i brought down up at barleduc and theres not a scratch on it simply a miracle you get all the loot when you bring down a machine do you claude asked encouragingly of course ive a good collection altimeters and compasses and glasses this lens i always carry with me because im afraid to leave it anywhere i suppose it makes a fellow feel pretty fine to bring down one of those german planes sometimes i brought down one too many though it was very unpleasant victor paused frowning but claudes open credulous face was too much for his reserve i brought down a woman once she was a plucky devil flew a scouting machine and had bothered us a bit going over our lines naturally we didnt know it was a woman until she came down she was crushed underneath things she lived a few hours and dictated a letter to her people i went out and dropped it inside their lines it was nasty business i was quite knocked out i got a fortnights leave in london though wheeler he broke out suddenly i wish i knew we were going there now id like it well enough if we were victor shrugged i should hope so he turned his chin in claudes direction see here if you like ill show you london its a promise americans never see it you know they sit in a y hut and write to their pollyannas or they go round hunting for the tower ill show you a city thats alive that is unless youve a preference for museums his listener laughed no i want to see life as they say umph id like to set you down in some places i can think of very well i invite you to dine with me at the savoy the first night were in london the curtain will rise on this world for you nobody admitted who isnt in evening dress the jewels will dazzle you actresses duchesses all the handsomest women in europe but i thought london was dark and gloomy since the war victor smiled and teased his small strawcoloured moustache with his thumb and middle finger there are a few bright spots left thank you he began to explain to a novice what life at the front was really like nobody who had seen service talked about the war or thought about it it was merely a condition under which they lived men talked about the particular regiment they were jealous of or the favoured division that was put in for all the show fighting everybody thought about his own game his personal life that he managed to keep going in spite of discipline his next leave how to get champagne without paying for it dodging the guard getting into scrapes with women and getting out again are you quick with your french he asked claude grinned not especially youd better brush up on it if you want to do anything with french girls i hear your mps are very strict you must be able to toss the word the minute you see a skirt and make your date before the guard gets onto you i suppose french girls havent any scruples claude remarked carelessly victor shrugged his narrow shoulders i havent found that girls have many anywhere when we canadians were training in england we all had our weekend wives i believe the girls in crystal lake used to be more or less fussybut thats long ago and far away you wont have any difficulty when victor was in the middle of a tale of amorous adventure a little different from any claude had ever heard tod fanning joined them the aviator did not acknowledge the presence of a new listener but when he had finished his story walked away with his special swagger his eyes fixed upon the distance fanning looked after him with disgust do you believe him i dont think hes any such heartsmasher i like his nerve calling you leftenant when he speaks to me hell have to say lootenant or ill spoil his beauty that day the men remembered long afterward for it was the end of the fine weather and of those first long carefree days at sea in the afternoon claude and the young marine the virginian and fanning sat together in the sun watching the water scoop itself out in hollows and pile itself up in blue rolling hills usher was telling his companions a long story about the landing of the marines at vera cruz its a great old town he concluded one thing there ill never forget some of the natives took a few of us out to the old prison that stands on a rock in the sea we put in the whole day there and it wasnt any tourist show believe me we went down into dungeons underneath the water where they used to keep state prisoners kept them buried alive for years we saw all the old instruments of torture rusty iron cages where a man couldnt lie down or stand up but had to sit bent over till he grew crooked it made you feel queer when you came up to think how people had been left to rot away down there when there was so much sun and water outside seems like something used to be the matter with the world he said no more but claude thought from his serious look that he believed he and his countrymen who were pouring overseas would help to change all that v that night the virginian who berthed under victor morse had an alarming attack of nosebleed and by morning he was so weak that he had to be carried to the hospital the doctor said they might as well face the facts a scourge of influenza had broken out on board of a peculiarly bloody and malignant type everybody was a little frightened some of the officers shut themselves up in the smokingroom and drank whiskey and soda and played poker all day as if they could keep contagion out the actual outbreak of influenza on transports carrying united states troops is here anticipated by several months lieutenant bird died late in the afternoon and was buried at sunrise the next day sewed up in a tarpaulin with an eighteen pound shell at his feet the morning broke brilliantly clear and bitter cold the sea was rolling blue walls of water and the boat was raked by a wind as sharp as ice excepting those who were sick the boys turned out to a man it was the first burial at sea they had ever witnessed and they couldnt help finding it interesting the chaplain read the burial service while they stood with uncovered heads the kansas band played a solemn march the swedish quartette sang a hymn many a man turned his face away when that brown sack was lowered into the cold leaping indigo ridges that seemed so destitute of anything friendly to human kind in a moment it was done and they steamed on without him the glittering walls of water kept rolling in indigo purple more brilliant than on the days of mild weather the blinding sunlight did not temper the cold which cut the face and made the lungs ache landsmen began to have that miserable sense of being where they were never meant to be the boys lay in heaps on the deck trying to keep warm by hugging each other close everybody was seasick fanning went to bed with his clothes on so sick he couldnt take off his boots claude lay in the crowded stern too cold too faint to move the sun poured over them like flame without any comfort in it the strong curling foamcrested waves threw off the light like millions of mirrors and their colour was almost more than the eye could bear the water seemed denser than before heavy like melted glass and the foam on the edges of each blue ridge looked sharp as crystals if a man should fall into them he would be cut to pieces the whole ocean seemed suddenly to have come to life the waves had a malignant graceful muscular energy were animated by a kind of mocking cruelty only a few hours ago a gentle boy had been thrown into that freezing water and forgotten yes already forgotten every one had his own miseries to think about late in the afternoon the wind fell and there was a sinister sunset across the red west a small ragged black cloud hurriedthen another and another they came up out of the seawild witchlike shapes that travelled fast and met in the west as if summoned for an evil conclave they hung there against the afterglow distinct black shapes drawing together devising something the few men who were left on deck felt that no good could come out of a sky like that they wished they were at home in france anywhere but here vi the next morning doctor trueman asked claude to help him at sick call ive got a bunch of sergeants taking temperatures but its too much for one man to oversee i dont want to ask anything of those dude officers who sit in there playing poker all the time either theyve got no conscience or theyre not awake to the gravity of the situation the doctor stood on deck in his raincoat his foot on the rail to keep his equilibrium writing on his knee as the long string of men came up to him there were more than seventy in the line that morning and some of them looked as if they ought to be in a drier place rain beat down on the sea like lead bullets the old anchises floundered from one grey ridge to another quite alone fog cut off the cheering sight of the sister ships the doctor had to leave his post from time to time when seasickness got the better of his will claude at his elbow was noting down names and temperatures in the middle of his work he told the sergeants to manage without him for a few minutes down near the end of the line he had seen one of his own men misconducting himself snivelling and crying like a babya fine husky boy of eighteen who had never given any trouble claude made a dash for him and clapped him on the shoulder if you cant stop that bert fuller get where you wont be seen i dont want all these english stewards standing around to watch an american soldier cry i never heard of such a thing i cant help it lieutenant the boy blubbered ive kept it back just as long as i can i cant hold in any longer whats the matter with you come over here and sit down on this box and tell me private fuller willingly let himself be led and dropped on the box im so sick lieutenant ill see how sick you are claude stuck a thermometer into his mouth and while he waited sent the deck steward to bring a cup of tea just as i thought fuller youve not half a degree of fever youre scared and thats all now drink this tea i expect you didnt eat any breakfast no sir i cant eat the awful stuff on this boat it is pretty bad where are you from im from pppleasantville up on the ppplatte the boy gulped and his tears began to flow afresh well now what would they think of you back there i suppose they got the band out and made a fuss over you when you went away and thought they were sending off a fine soldier and ive always thought youd be a first rate soldier i guess well forget about this you feel better already dont you yes sir this tastes awful good ive been so sick to my stomach and last night i got pains in my chest all my crowd is sick and you took big tannhauser i mean corporal away to the hospital it looks like were all going to die out here i know its a little gloomy but dont you shame me before these english stewards i wont do it again sir he promised when the medical inspection was over claude took the doctor down to see fanning who had been coughing and wheezing all night and hadnt got out of his berth the examination was short the doctor knew what was the matter before he put the stethoscope on him its pneumonia both lungs he said when they came out into the corridor i have one case in the hospital that will die before morning what can you do for him doctor you see how im fixed close onto two hundred men sick and one doctor the medical supplies are wholly inadequate theres not castor oil enough on this boat to keep the men clean inside im using my own drugs but they wont last through an epidemic like this i cant do much for lieutenant fanning you can though if youll give him the time you can take better care of him right here than he could get in the hospital we havent an empty bed there claude found victor morse and told him he had better get a berth in one of the other staterooms when victor left with his belongings fanning stared after him is he going yes its too crowded in here if youve got to stay in bed glad of it his stories are too raw for me im no sissy but that fellows a regular don quixote claude laughed you mustnt talk it makes you cough wheres the virginian who bird claude asked in astonishmentfanning had stood beside him at birds funeral oh hes gone too you sleep if you can after dinner doctor trueman came in and showed claude how to give his patient an alcohol bath its simply a question of whether you can keep up his strength dont try any of this greasy food they serve here give him a raw egg beaten up in the juice of an orange every two hours night and day waken him out of his sleep when its time dont miss a single twohour period ill write an order to your table steward and you can beat the eggs up here in your cabin now i must go to the hospital its wonderful what those band boys are doing there i begin to take some pride in the place that big german has been asking for you hes in a very bad way as there were no nurses on board the kansas band had taken over the hospital they had been trained for stretcher and first aid work and when they realized what was happening on the anchises the bandmaster came to the doctor and offered the services of his men he chose nurses and orderlies divided them into night and day shifts when claude went to see his corporal big tannhauser did not recognize him he was quite out of his head and was conversing with his own family in the language of his early childhood the kansas boys had singled him out for special attention the mere fact that he kept talking in a tongue forbidden on the surface of the seas made him seem more friendless and alone than the others from the hospital claude went down into the hold where halfadozen of his company were lying ill the hold was damp and musty as an old cellar so steeped in the smells and leakage of innumerable dirty cargoes that it could not be made or kept clean there was almost no ventilation and the air was fetid with sickness and sweat and vomit two of the band boys were working in the stench and dirt helping the stewards claude stayed to lend a hand until it was time to give fanning his nourishment he began to see that the wrist watch which he had hitherto despised as effeminate and had carried in his pocket might be a very useful article after he had made fanning swallow his egg he piled all the available blankets on him and opened the port to give the cabin an airing while the fresh wind blew in he sat down on the edge of his berth and tried to collect his wits what had become of those first days of golden weather leisure and goodcomradeship the band concerts the lindsborg quartette the first excitement and novelty of being at sea all that had gone by like a dream that night when the doctor came in to see fanning he threw his stethoscope on the bed and said wearily its a wonder that instrument doesnt take root in my ears and grow there he sat down and sucked his thermometer for a few minutes then held it out for inspection claude looked at it and told him he ought to go to bed then whos to be up and around no bed for me tonight but i will have a hot bath by and by claude asked why the ships doctor didnt do anything and added that he must be as little as he looked chessup no hes not half bad when you get to know him hes given me a lot of help about preparing medicines and its a great assistance to talk the cases over with him hell do anything for me except directly handle the patients he doesnt want to exceed his authority it seems the english marine is very particular about such things hes a canadian and he graduated first in his class at edinburgh i gather he was frozen out in private practice you see his appearance is against him its an awful handicap to look like a kid and be as shy as he is the doctor rose shored up his shoulders and took his bag youre looking fine yourself lieutenant he remarked parents both living were they quite young when you were born well then their parents were probably im a crank about that yes ill get my bath pretty soon and i will lie down for an hour or two with those splendid band boys running the hospital i get a little leeway claude wondered how the doctor kept going he knew he hadnt had more than four hours sleep out of the last fortyeight and he was not a man of rugged constitution his bath steward was as he said his comfort hawkins was an old fellow who had held better positions on better boatsyes in better times too he had first gone to sea as a bath steward and now through the fortunes of war he had come back where he begannot a good place for an old man his back was bent meekly and he shuffled along with broken arches he looked after the comfort of all the officers and attended the doctor like a valet got out his clean linen persuaded him to lie down and have a hot drink after his bath stood on guard at his door to take messages for him in the short hours when he was resting hawkins had lost two sons in the war and he seemed to find a solemn consolation in being of service to soldiers take it a bit easy now sir youll ave it ard enough over there he used to say to one and another at eleven oclock one of the kansas men came to tell claude that his corporal was going fast big tannhausers fever had left him but so had everything else he lay in a stupor his congested eyeballs were rolled back in his head and only the yellowish whites were visible his mouth was open and his tongue hung out at one side from the end of the corridor claude had heard the frightful sounds that came from his throat sounds like violent vomiting or the choking rattle of a man in strangulationand indeed he was being strangled one of the band boys brought claude a camp chair and said kindly he doesnt suffer its mechanical now hed go easier if he hadnt so much vitality the doctor says he may have a few moments of consciousness just at the last if you want to stay ill go down and give my private patient his egg and then ill come back claude went away and returned and sat dozing by the bed after three oclock the noise of struggle ceased instantly the huge figure on the bed became again his goodnatured corporal the mouth closed the glassy jellies were once more seeing intelligent human eyes the face lost its swollen brutish look and was again the face of a friend it was almost unbelievable that anything so far gone could come back he looked up wistfully at his lieutenant as if to ask him something his eyes filled with tears and he turned his head away a little mein arme mutter he whispered distinctly a few moments later he died in perfect dignity not struggling under torture but consciously it seemed to claudelike a brave boy giving back what was not his to keep claude returned to his cabin roused fanning once more and then threw himself upon his tipping bunk the boat seemed to wallow and sprawl in the waves as he had seen animals do on the farm when they gave birth to young how helpless the old vessel was out here in the pounding seas and how much misery she carried he lay looking up at the rusty water pipes and unpainted joinings this liner was in truth the old anchises even the carpenters who made her over for the service had not thought her worth the trouble and had done their worst by her the new partitions were hung to the joists by a few nails big tannhauser had been one of those who were most anxious to sail he used to grin and say france is the only climate thats healthy for a man with a name like mine he had waved his goodbye to the image in the new york harbour with the rest believed in her like the rest he only wanted to serve it seemed hard when tannhauser first came to camp he was confused all the time and couldnt remember instructions claude had once stepped him out in front of the line and reprimanded him for not knowing his right side from his left when he looked into the case he found that the fellow was not eating anything that he was ill from homesickness he was one of those farmer boys who are afraid of town the giant baby of a long family he had never slept away from home a night in his life before he enlisted corporal tannhauser along with four others was buried at sunrise no band this time the chaplain was ill so one of the young captains read the service claude stood by watching until the sailors shot one sack longer by half a foot than the other four into a leadcoloured chasm in the sea there was not even a splash after breakfast one of the kansas orderlies called him into a little cabin where they had prepared the dead men for burial the army regulations minutely defined what was to be done with a deceased soldiers effects his uniform shoes blankets arms personal baggage were all disposed of according to instructions but in each case there was a residue the dead mans toothbrushes his razors and the photographs he carried upon his person there they were in five pathetic little heaps what should be done with them claude took up the photographs that had belonged to his corporal one was a fat foolishlooking girl in a white dress that was too tight for her and a floppy hat a little flag pinned on her plump bosom the other was an old woman seated her hands crossed in her lap her thin hair was drawn back tight from a hard angular faceunmistakably an oldworld faceand her eyes squinted at the camera she looked honest and stubborn and unconvinced he thought as if she did not in the least understand ill take these he said and the othersjust pitch them over dont you think vii b companys first officer captain maxey was so seasick throughout the voyage that he was of no help to his men in the epidemic it must have been a frightful blow to his pride for nobody was ever more anxious to do an officers whole duty claude had known harris maxey slightly in lincoln had met him at the erlichs and afterward kept up a campus acquaintance with him he hadnt liked maxey then and he didnt like him now but he thought him a good officer maxeys family were poor folk from mississippi who had settled in nemaha county and he was very ambitious not only to get on in the world but as he said to be somebody his life at the university was a feverish pursuit of social advantages and useful acquaintances his feeling for the right people amounted to veneration after his graduation maxey served on the mexican border he was a tireless drill master and threw himself into his duties with all the energy of which his frail physique was capable he was slight and fairskinned a rigid jaw threw his lower teeth out beyond the upper ones and made his face look stiff his whole manner tense and nervous was the expression of a passionate desire to excel claude seemed to himself to be leading a double life these days when he was working over fanning or was down in the hold helping to take care of the sick soldiers he had no time to thinkdid mechanically the next thing that came to hand but when he had an hour to himself on deck the tingling sense of everwidening freedom flashed up in him again the weather was a continual adventure he had never known any like it before the fog and rain the grey sky and the lonely grey stretches of the ocean were like something he had imagined long agomemories of old sea stories read in childhood perhapsand they kindled a warm spot in his heart here on the anchises he seemed to begin where childhood had left off the ugly hiatus between had closed up years of his life were blotted out in the fog this fog which had been at first depressing had become a shelter a tent moving through space hiding one from all that had been before giving one a chance to correct ones ideas about life and to plan the future the past was physically shut off that was his illusion he had already travelled a great many more miles than were told off by the ships log when bandmaster fred max asked him to play chess he had to stop a moment and think why it was that game had such disagreeable associations for him enids pale deceptive face seldom rose before him unless some such accident brought it up if he happened to come upon a group of boys talking about their sweethearts and warbrides he listened a moment and then moved away with the happy feeling that he was the least married man on the boat there was plenty of deck room now that so many men were ill either from seasickness or the epidemic and sometimes he and albert usher had the stormy side of the boat almost to themselves the marine was the best sort of companion for these gloomy days steady quiet selfreliant and he too was always looking forward as for victor morse claude was growing positively fond of him victor had tea in a special corner of the officers smokingroom every afternoonhe would have perished without itand the steward always produced some special garnishes of toast and jam or sweet biscuit for him claude usually managed to join him at that hour on the day of tannhausers funeral he went into the smokingroom at four victor beckoned the steward and told him to bring a couple of hot whiskeys with the tea youre very wet you know wheeler and you really should there he said as he put down his glass dont you feel better with a drink very much i think ill have another its agreeable to be warm inside two more steward and bring me some fresh lemon the occupants of the room were either reading or talking in low tones one of the swedish boys was playing softly on the old piano victor began to pour the tea he had a neat way of doing it and today he was especially solicitous this scotch mist gets into ones bones doesnt it i thought you were looking rather seedy when i passed you on deck i was up with tannhauser last night didnt get more than an hours sleep claude murmured yawning yes i heard you lost your big corporal im sorry ive had bad news too its out now that were to make a french port that dashes all my plans however cest la guerre he pushed back his cup with a shrug take a turn outside claude had often wondered why victor liked him since he was so little victors kind if it isnt a secret he said id like to know how you ever got into the british army anyway as they walked up and down in the rain victor told his story briefly when he had finished high school he had gone into his fathers bank at crystal lake as bookkeeper after banking hours he skated played tennis or worked in the strawberrybed according to the season he bought two pairs of white pants every summer and ordered his shirts from chicago and thought he was a swell he said he got himself engaged to the preachers daughter two years ago the summer he was twenty his father wanted him to see niagara falls so he wrote a modest check warned his son against saloonsvictor had never been inside oneagainst expensive hotels and women who came up to ask the time without an introduction and sent him off telling him it wasnt necessary to fee porters or waiters at niagara falls victor fell in with some young canadian officers who opened his eyes to a great many things he went over to toronto with them enlistment was going strong and he saw an avenue of escape from the bank and the strawberry bed the air force seemed the most brilliant and attractive branch of the service they accepted him and here he was youll never go home again claude said with conviction i dont see you settling down in any little iowa town in the air service said victor carelessly we dont concern ourselves about the future its not worth while he took out a dull gold cigarette case which claude had noticed before let me see that a minute will you ive often admired it a present from somebody you like isnt it a twitch of feeling something quite genuine passed over the airmans boyish face and his rather small red mouth compressed sharply yes a woman i want you to meet here twitching his chin over his high collar ill write maisies address on my card introducing lieutenant wheeler aef thats all youll need if you should get to london before i do dont hesitate call on her at once present this card and shell receive you claude thanked him and put the card in his pocketbook while victor lit a cigarette i havent forgotten that youre dining with us at the savoy if we happen in london together if im there you can always find me her address is mine it will really be a great thing for you to meet a woman like maisie shell be nice to you because youre my friend he went on to say that she had done everything in the world for him had left her husband and given up her friends on his account she now had a studio flat in chelsea where she simply waited his coming and dreaded his going it was an awful life for her she entertained other officers of course old acquaintances but it was all camouflage he was the man victor went so far as to produce her picture and claude gazed without knowing what to say at a large moonshaped face with heavylidded weary eyesthe neck clasped by a pearl collar the shoulders bare to the matronly swell of the bosom there was not a line or wrinkle in that smooth expanse of flesh but from the heavy mouth and chin from the very shape of the face it was easy to see that she was quite old enough to be victors mother across the photograph was written in a large splashy hand a mon aigle had victor been delicate enough to leave him in any doubt claude would have preferred to believe that his relations with this lady were wholly of a filial nature women like her simply dont exist in your part of the world the aviator murmured as he snapped the photograph case shes a linguist and musician and all that with her everyday living is a fine art life as she says is what one makes it in itself its nothing where you came from its nothinga sleeping sickness claude laughed i dont know that i agree with you but i like to hear you talk well in that part of france thats all shot to pieces youll find more life going on in the cellars than in your home town wherever that is id rather be a stevedore in the london docks than a bankerking in one of your prairie states in london if youre lucky enough to have a shilling you can get something for it yes things are pretty tame at home the other admitted tame my god its death in life whats left of men if you take all the fire out of them theyre afraid of everything i know them sundayschool sneaks prowling around those little towns after dark victor abruptly dismissed the subject by the way youre pals with the doctor arent you im needing some medicine that is somewhere in my lost trunk would you mind asking him if he can put up this prescription i dont want to go to him myself all these medicos blab and he might report me ive been lucky dodging medical inspections you see i dont want to get held up anywhere tell him its not for you of course when claude presented the piece of blue paper to doctor trueman he smiled contemptuously i see this has been filled by a london chemist no we have nothing of this sort he handed it back those things are only palliatives if your friend wants that he needs treatmentand he knows where he can get it claude returned the slip of paper to victor as they left the diningroom after supper telling him he hadnt been able to get any sorry said victor flushing haughtily thank you so much viii tod fanning held out better than many of the stronger men his vitality surprised the doctor the death list was steadily growing and the worst of it was that patients died who were not very sick vigorous cleanblooded young fellows of nineteen and twenty turned over and died because they had lost their courage because other people were dyingbecause death was in the air the corridors of the vessel had the smell of death about them doctor trueman said it was always so in an epidemic patients died who had they been isolated cases would have recovered do you know wheeler the doctor remarked one day when they came up from the hospital together to get a breath of air i sometimes wonder whether all these inoculations theyve been having against typhoid and smallpox and whatnot havent lowered their vitality ill go off my head if i keep losing men what would you give to be out of it all and safe back on the farm hearing no reply he turned his head peered over his raincoat collar and saw a startled resisting look in the young mans blue eyes followed by a quick flush you dont want to be back on the farm do you not a little bit well well thats what it is to be young he shook his head with a smile which might have been commiseration might have been envy and went back to his duties claude stayed where he was drawing the wet grey air into his lungs and feeling vexed and reprimanded it was quite true he realized the doctor had caught him he was enjoying himself all the while and didnt want to be safe anywhere he was sorry about tannhauser and the others but he was not sorry for himself the discomforts and misfortunes of this voyage had not spoiled it for him he grumbled of course because others did but life had never seemed so tempting as it did here and now he could come up from heavy work in the hospital or from poor fanning and his everlasting eggs and forget all that in ten minutes something inside him as elastic as the grey ridges over which they were tipping kept bounding up and saying i am all here ive left everything behind me i am going over only on that one day the cold day of the virginians funeral when he was seasick had he been really miserable he must be heartless certainly not to be overwhelmed by the sufferings of his own men his own friendsbut he wasnt he had them on his mind and did all he could for them but it seemed to him just now that he took a sort of satisfaction in that too and was somewhat vain of his usefulness to doctor trueman a nice attitude he awoke every morning with that sense of freedom and going forward as if the world were growing bigger each day and he were growing with it other fellows were sick and dying and that was terriblebut he and the boat went on and always on something was released that had been struggling for a long while he told himself he had been due in france since the first battle of the marne he had followed false leads and lost precious time and seen misery enough but he was on the right road at last and nothing could stop him if he hadnt been so green so bashful so afraid of showing what he felt and so stupid at finding his way about he would have enlisted in canada like victor or run away to france and joined the foreign legion all that seemed perfectly possible now why hadnt he well that was not the wheelers way the wheelers were terribly afraid of poking themselves in where they werent wanted of pushing their way into a crowd where they didnt belong and they were even more afraid of doing anything that might look affected or romantic they couldnt let themselves adopt a conspicuous much less a picturesque course of action unless it was all in the days work well history had condescended to such as he this whole brilliant adventure had become the days work he had got into it after all along with victor and the marine and other fellows who had more imagination and selfconfidence in the first place three years ago he used to sit moping by the windmill because he didnt see how a nebraska farmer boy had any call or indeed any way to throw himself into the struggle in france he used enviously to read about alan seeger and those fortunate american boys who had a right to fight for a civilization they knew but the miracle had happened a miracle so wide in its amplitude that the wheelersall the wheelers and the roughnecks and the lowbrows were caught up in it yes it was the roughnecks own miracle all this it was their golden chance he was in on it and nothing could hinder or discourage him unless he were put over the side himselfwhich was only a way of joking for that was a possibility he never seriously considered the feeling of purpose of fateful purpose was strong in his breast ix look at this doctor claude caught dr trueman on his way from breakfast and handed him a written notice signed d t micks chief steward it stated that no more eggs or oranges could be furnished to patients as the supply was exhausted the doctor squinted at the paper im afraid thats your patients death warrant youll never be able to keep him going on anything else why dont you go and talk it over with chessup hes a resourceful fellow ill join you there in a few minutes claude had often been to dr chessups cabin since the epidemic broke outrather liked to wait there when he went for medicines or advice it was a comfortable personal sort of place with cheerful chintz hangings the walls were lined with books held in place by sliding wooden slats padlocked at the ends there were a great many scientific works in german and english the rest were french novels in paper covers this morning he found chessup weighing out white powders at his desk in the rack over his bunk was the book with which he had read himself to sleep last night the title un crime damour lettered in black on yellow caught claudes eye the doctor put on his coat and pointed his visitor to the jointed chair in which patients were sometimes examined claude explained his predicament the ships doctor was a strange fellow to come from canada the land of big men and rough he looked like a schoolboy with small hands and feet and a pink complexion on his left cheekbone was a large brown mole covered with silky hair and for some reason that seemed to make his face effeminate it was easy to see why he had not been successful in private practice he was like somebody trying to protect a raw surface from heat and cold so cursed with diffidence and so sensitive about his boyish appearance that he chose to shut himself up in an oscillating wooden coop on the sea the long run to australia had exactly suited him a rough life and the pounding of bad weather had fewer terrors for him than an office in town with constant exposure to human personalities have you tried him on malted milk he asked when claude had told him how farmings nourishment was threatened dr trueman hasnt a bottle left how long do you figure well be at sea four days possibly five then lieutenant wheeler will lose his pal said dr trueman who had just come in chessup stood for a moment frowning and pulling nervously at the brass buttons on his coat he slid the bolt on his door and turning to his colleague said resolutely i can give you some information if you wont implicate me you can do as you like but keep my name out of it for several hours last night cases of eggs and boxes of oranges were being carried into the chief stewards cabin by a flunky of his from the galley whatever port we make he can get a shilling each for the fresh eggs and perhaps sixpence for the oranges they are your property of course furnished by your government but this is his customary perquisite ive been on this boat six years and its always been so about a week before we make port the choicest of the remaining stores are taken to his cabin and he disposes of them after we dock i cant say just how he manages it but he does the skipper may know of this custom and there may be some reason why he permits it its not my business to see anything the chief steward is a powerful man on an english vessel if he has anything against me sooner or later he can lose my berth for me there you have the facts have i your permission to go to the chief steward dr trueman asked certainly not but you can go without my knowledge hes an ugly man to cross and he can make it uncomfortable for you and your patients well well say no more about it i appreciate your telling me and i will see that you dont get mixed up in this will you go down with me to look at that new meningitis case claude waited impatiently in his stateroom for the doctors return he didnt see why the chief steward shouldnt be exposed and dealt with like any other grafter he had hated the man ever since he heard him berating the old bath steward one morning hawkins had made no attempt to defend himself but stood like a dog that has been terribly beaten trembling all over saying yes sir yes sir while his chief gave him a cold cursing in a low snarling voice claude had never heard a man or even an animal addressed with such contempt the steward had a cruel facewhite as cheese with limp moist hair combed back from a high foreheadthe peculiarly oily hair that seems to grow only on the heads of stewards and waiters his eyes were exactly the shape of almonds but the lids were so swollen that the dull pupil was visible only through a narrow slit a long pale moustache hung like a fringe over his loose lips when dr trueman came back from the hospital he declared he was now ready to call on mr micks hes a nasty looking customer but he cant do anything to me they went to the chief stewards cabin and knocked whats wanted called a threatening voice the doctor made a grimace to his companion and walked in the steward was sitting at a big desk covered with account books he turned in his chair i beg your pardon he said coldly i do not see any one here i will be the doctor held up his hand quickly thats all right steward im sorry to intrude but ive something i must say to you in private ill not detain you long if he had hesitated for a moment claude believed the steward would have thrown him out but he went on rapidly this is lieutenant wheeler mr micks his fellow officer lies very ill with pneumonia in stateroom 96 lieutenant wheeler has kept him alive by special nursing he is not able to retain anything in his stomach but eggs and orange juice if he has these we may be able to keep up his strength till the fever breaks and carry him to a hospital in france if we cant get them for him he will be dead within twentyfour hours thats the situation the steward rose and turned out the droplight on his desk have you received notice that there are no more eggs and oranges on board then i am afraid there is nothing i can do for you i did not provision this ship no i understand that i believe the united states government provided the fruit and eggs and meat and i positively know that the articles i need for my patient are not exhausted without going into the matter further i warn you that im not going to let a united states officer die when the means of saving him are procurable ill go to the skipper ill call a meeting of the army officers on board ill go any length to save this man that is your own affair but you will not interfere with me in the discharge of my duties will you leave my cabin in a moment steward i know that last night a number of cases of eggs and oranges were carried into this room they are here now and they belong to the aef if you will agree to provision my man what i know wont go any further but if you refuse ill get this matter investigated i wont stop till i do the steward sat down and took up a pen his large soft hand looked cheesy like his face what is the number of the cabin he asked indifferently ninetysix exactly what do you require one dozen eggs and one dozen oranges every twentyfour hours to be delivered at any time convenient to you i will see what i can do the steward did not look up from his writing pad and his visitors left as abruptly as they had come at about four oclock every morning before even the bath stewards were on duty there was a scratching at claudes door and a covered basket was left there by a messenger who was unwashed halfnaked with a sacking apron tied round his middle and his hairy chest splashed with flour he never spoke had only one eye and an inflamed socket claude learned that he was a halfwitted brother of the chief steward a potato peeler and dishwasher in the galley four day after their interview with mr micks when they were at last nearing the end of the voyage doctor trueman detained claude after medical inspection to tell him that the chief steward had come down with the epidemic he sent for me last night and asked me to take his casewont have anything to do with chessup i had to get chessups permission he seemed very glad to hand the case over to me is he very bad he hasnt a lookin and he knows it complications chronic brights disease it seems he has nine children ill try to get him into a hospital when we make port but hell only live a few days at most i wonder wholl get the shillings for all the eggs and oranges he hoarded away claude my boy the doctor spoke with sudden energy if i ever set foot on land again im going to forget this voyage like a bad dream when im in normal health im a presbyterian but just now i feel that even the wicked get worse than they deserve a day came at last when claude was wakened from sleep by a sense of stillness he sprang up with a dazed fear that some one had died but fanning lay in his berth breathing quietly something caught his eye through the portholea great grey shoulder of land standing up in the pink light of dawn powerful and strangely still after the distressing instability of the sea pale trees and long low fortifications close grey buildings with red roofs little sailboats bounding seaward up on the cliff a gloomy fortress he had always thought of his destination as a country shattered and desolatedbleeding france but he had never seen anything that looked so strong so selfsufficient so fixed from the first foundation as the coast that rose before him it was like a pillar of eternity the ocean lay submissive at its feet and over it was the great meekness of early morning this grey wall unshaken mighty was the end of the long preparation as it was the end of the sea it was the reason for everything that had happened in his life for the last fifteen months it was the reason why tannhauser and the gentle virginian and so many others who had set out with him were never to have any life at all or even a soldiers death they were merely waste in a great enterprise thrown overboard like rotten ropes for them this kind releasetrees and a still shore and quiet waterwas never never to be how long would their bodies toss he wondered in that inhuman kingdom of darkness and unrest he was startled by a weak voice from behind claude are we over yes fanning were over book five bidding the eagles of the west fly on i at noon that day claude found himself in a street of little shops hot and perspiring utterly confused and turned about truck drivers and boys on bell less bicycles shouted at him indignantly furiously he got under the shade of a young plane tree and stood close to the trunk as if it might protect him his greatest care at any rate was off his hands with the help of victor morse he had hired a taxi for forty francs taken fanning to the base hospital and seen him into the arms of a big orderly from texas he came away from the hospital with no idea where he was goingexcept that he wanted to get to the heart of the city it seemed however to have no heart only long stony arteries full of heat and noise he was still standing there under his plane tree when a group of uncertain lostlooking brown figures headed by sergeant hicks came weaving up the street nine men in nine different attitudes of dejection each with a long loaf of bread under his arm they hailed claude with joy straightened up and looked as if now they had found their way he saw that he must be a plane tree for somebody else sergeant hicks explained that they had been trudging about the town looking for cheese after sixteen days of heavy tasteless food cheese was what they all wanted there was a grocery store up the street where there seemed to be everything else he had tried to make the old woman understand by signs dont these french people eat cheese anyhow whats their word for it lieutenant im damned if i know and ive lost my phrase book suppose you could make her understand well ill try come along boys crowding close together the ten men entered the shop the proprietress ran forward with an exclamation of despair evidently she had thought she was done with them and was not pleased to see them coming back when she paused to take breath claude took off his hat respectfully and performed the bravest act of his life uttered the first phrasebook sentence he had ever spoken to a french person his men were at his back he had to say something or run there was no other course looking the old woman in the eye he steadily articulated avezvous du fromage madame it was almost inspiration to add the last word he thought and when it worked he was as much startled as if his revolver had gone off in his belt du fromage the shop woman screamed calling something to her daughter who was at the desk she caught claude by the sleeve pulled him out of the shop and ran down the street with him she dragged him into a doorway darkened by a long curtain greeted the proprietress and then pushed the men after their officer as if they were stubborn burros they stood blinking in the gloom inhaling a sour damp buttery smearkase smell until their eyes penetrated the shadows and they saw that there was nothing but cheese and butter in the place the shopkeeper was a fat woman with black eyebrows that met above her nose her sleeves were rolled up her cotton dress was open over her white throat and bosom she began at once to tell them that there was a restriction on milk products every one must have cards she could not sell them so much but soon there was nothing left to dispute about the boys fell upon her stock like wolves the little white cheeses that lay on green leaves disappeared into big mouths before she could save it hicks had split a big round cheese through the middle and was carving it up like a melon she told them they were dirty pigs and worse than the boches but she could not stop them whats the matter with mother lieutenant whats she fussing about aint she here to sell goods claude tried to look wiser than he was from what i can make out theres some sort of restriction you arent allowed to buy all you want we ought to have thought about that this is a war country i guess weve about cleaned her out oh thats all right said hicks wiping his claspknife well bring her some sugar tomorrow one of the fellows who helped us unload at the docks told me you can always quiet em if you give em sugar they surrounded her and held out their money for her to take her pay come on mam dont be bashful whats the matter aint this good money she was distracted by the noise they made by their bronzed faces with white teeth and pale eyes crowding so close to her ten large wellshaped hands with straight fingers the open palms full of crumpled notes holding the men off under the pretence of looking for a pencil she made rapid calculations the money that lay in their palms had no relation to these big coaxing boisterous fellows it was a joke to them they didnt know what it meant in the world behind them were shiploads of money and behind the ships the situation was unfair whether she took much or little out of their hands couldnt possibly matter to the americans couldnt even dash their good humour but there was a strain on the cheesewoman and the standards of a lifetime were in jeopardy her mind mechanically fixed upon twoandahalf she would charge them twoandahalf times the market price of the cheese with this moral plank to cling to she made change with conscientious accuracy and did not keep a penny too much from anybody telling them what big stupids they were and that it was necessary to learn to count in this world she urged them out of her shop she liked them well enough but she did not like to do business with them if she didnt take their money the next one would all the same fictitious values were distasteful to her and made everything seem flimsy and unsafe standing in her doorway she watched the brown band go ambling down the street as they passed in front of the old church of st jacques the two foremost stumbled on a sunken step that was scarcely above the level of the pavement she laughed aloud they looked back and waved to her she replied with a smile that was both friendly and angry she liked them but not the legend of waste and prodigality that ran before themand followed after it was superfluous and disintegrating in a world of hard facts an army in which the men had meat for breakfast and ate more every day than the french soldiers at the front got in a week their moving kitchens and supply trains were the wonder of france down below arles where her husbands sister had married on the desolate plain of the crau their tinned provisions were piled like mountain ranges under sheds and canvas nobody had ever seen so much food before coffee milk sugar bacon hams everything the world was famished for they brought shiploads of useless things too and useless people shiploads of women who were not nurses some said they came to dance with the officers so they would not be ennuyés all this was not warany more than having money thrust at you by grown men who could not count was business it was an invasion like the other the first destroyed material possessions and this threatened everybodys integrity distaste of such methods deep recoiling distrust of them clouded the cheesewomans brow as she threw her money into the drawer and turned the key on it as for the doughboys having once stubbed their toes on the sunken step they examined it with interest and went in to explore the church it was in their minds that they must not let a church escape any more than they would let a boche escape within they came upon a bunch of their shipmates including the kansas band to whom they boasted that their lieutenant could speak french like a native the lieutenant himself thought he was getting on pretty well but a few hours later his pride was humbled he was sitting alone in a little triangular park beside another church admiring the cropped locust trees and watching some old women who were doing their mending in the shade a little boy in a black apron with a closeshaved bare head came along skipping rope he hopped lightly up to claude and said in a most persuasive and confiding voice voulezvous me dire lheure sil vous plaît msieu l soldat claude looked down into his admiring eyes with a feeling of panic he wouldnt mind being dumb to a man or even to a pretty girl but this was terrible his tongue went dry and his face grew scarlet the childs expectant gaze changed to a look of doubt and then of fear he had spoken before to americans who didnt understand but they had not turned red and looked angry like this one this soldier must be ill or wrong in his head the boy turned and ran away many a serious mishap had distressed claude less he was disappointed too there was something friendly in the boys face that he wanted that he needed as he rose he ground his heel into the gravel unless i can learn to talk to the children of this country he muttered ill go home ii claude set off to find the grand hotel where he had promised to dine with victor morse the porter there spoke english he called a redheaded boy in a dirty uniform and told him to take the american to vingtquatre the boy also spoke english plenty money in new york i guess in france no money he made their way through musty corridors and up slippery staircases as long as possible shrewdly eyeing the visitor and rubbing his thumb nervously against his fingers all the while vingtquatre twenyfour he announced rapping at a door with one hand and suggestively opening the other claude put something into itanything to be rid of him victor was standing before the fireplace hello wheeler come in our dinner will be served up here its big enough isnt it i could get nothing between a coop and this at fifteen dollars a day the room was spacious enough for a banquet with two huge beds and great windows that swung in on hinges like doors and that had certainly not been washed since before the war the heavy red cottonbrocade hangings and lace curtains were stiff with dust the thick carpet was strewn with cigaretteends and matches razor blades and khaki comfort boxes lay about on the dresser and former occupants had left their autographs in the dust on the table officers slept there and went away and other officers arrivedand the room remained the same like a wood in which travellers camp for the night the valet de chambre carried away only what he could use discarded shirts and socks and old shoes it seemed a rather dismal place to have a party when the waiter came he dusted off the table with his apron and put on a clean cloth napkins and glasses victor and his guest sat down under an electric light bulb with a broken shade around which a silent halo of flies moved unceasingly they did not buzz or dart aloft or descend to try the soup but hung there in the center of the room as if they were a part of the lighting system the constant attendance of the waiter embarrassed claude he felt as if he were being watched by the way said victor while the soup plates were being removed what do you think of this wine it cost me thirty francs the bottle it tastes very good to me claude replied but then its the first champagne ive ever drunk really victor drank off another glass and sighed i envy you i wish i had it all to do over lifes too short you know i should say you had made a good beginning were a long way from crystal lake not far enough his host reached across the table and filled claudes empty glass i sometimes waken up with the feeling im back there or i have bad dreams and find myself sitting on that damned stool in the glass cage and cant make my books balance i hear the old man coughing in his private room the way he coughs when hes going to refuse a loan to some poor devil who needs it ive had a narrow escape wheeler as a brand from the burning thats all the scripture i remember the bright red spots on victors cheeks his pale forehead and brilliant eyes and saucy little moustaches seemed to give his quotation a peculiar vividness claude envied him it must be great fun to take up a part and play it to a finish to believe you were making yourself over and to admire the kind of fellow you made he too in a way admired victorthough he couldnt altogether believe in him youll never go back he said i wouldnt worry about that take it from me there are thousands who will never go back im not speaking of the casualties some of you americans are likely to discover the world this trip and itll make the hell of a lot of difference you boys never had a fair chance theres a conspiracy of church and state to keep you down im going off to play with some girls tonight will you come along claude laughed i guess not why not you wont be caught i guarantee i guess not claude spoke apologetically im going out to see fanning after dinner victor shrugged that ass he beckoned the waiter to open another bottle and bring the coffee well its your last chance to go nutting with me he looked intently at claude and lifted his glass to the future and our next meeting when he put down his empty goblet he remarked i got a wire through today im leaving tomorrow for london for verdun claude took a quick breath verdun the very sound of the name was grim like the hollow roll of drums victor was going there tomorrow here one could take a train for verdun or thereabouts as at home one took a train for omaha he felt more over than he had done before and a little crackle of excitement went all through him he tried to be careless then you wont get to london soon god knows victor answered gloomily he looked up at the ceiling and began to whistle softly an engaging air do you know that its something maisie often plays roses of picardy you wont know what a woman can be till you meet her wheeler i hope ill have that pleasure i was wondering if youd forgotten her for the moment she doesnt object to these diversions victor lifted his eyebrows in the old haughty way women dont require that sort of fidelity of the air service our engagements are too uncertain half an hour later victor had gone in quest of amorous adventure and claude was wandering alone in a brightly lighted street full of soldiers and sailors of all nations there were black senegalese and highlanders in kilts and little lorrydrivers from siamall moving slowly along between rows of cabarets and cinema theatres the widespreading branches of the plane trees met overhead shutting out the sky and roofing in the orange glare the sidewalks were crowded with chairs and little tables at which marines and soldiers sat drinking schnapps and cognac and coffee from every doorway musicmachines poured out jazz tunes and strident sousa marches the noise was stupefying out in the middle of the street a band of bareheaded girls hardy and tough looking were following a string of awkward americans running into them elbowing them asking for treats crying you dance me faussetrot sammie claude stationed himself before a movie theatre where the sign in electric lights read amour quand tu nous tiens and stood watching the people in the stream that passed him his eye lit upon two walking arminarm their hands clasped talking eagerly and unconscious of the crowddifferent he saw at once from all the other strolling affectionate couples the man wore the american uniform his left arm had been amputated at the elbow and he carried his head awry as if he had a stiff neck his dark lean face wore an expression of intense anxiety his eyebrows twitched as if he were in constant pain the girl too looked troubled as they passed him under the red light of the amour sign claude could see that her eyes were full of tears they were wide blue eyes innocent looking and she had the prettiest face he had seen since he landed from her silk shawl and little bonnet with blue strings and a white frill he thought she must be a country girl as she listened to the soldier with her mouth halfopen he saw a space between her two front teeth as with children whose second teeth have just come while they pushed along in the crowd she looked up intently at the man beside her or off into the blur of light where she evidently saw nothing her face young and soft seemed new to emotion and her bewildered look made one feel that she did not know where to turn without realizing what he did claude followed them out of the crowd into a quiet street and on into another even more deserted where the houses looked as if they had been asleep a long while here there were no street lamps not even a light in the windows but natural darkness with the moon high overhead throwing sharp shadows across the white cobble paving the narrow street made a bend and he came out upon the church he and his comrades had entered that afternoon it looked larger by night and but for the sunken step he might not have been sure it was the same the dark neighbouring houses seemed to lean toward it the moonlight shone silvergrey upon its battered front the two walking before him ascended the steps and withdrew into the deep doorway where they clung together in an embrace so long and still that it was like death at last they drew shuddering apart the girl sat down on the stone bench beside the door the soldier threw himself upon the pavement at her feet and rested his head on her knee his one arm lying across her lap in the shadow of the houses opposite claude kept watch like a sentinel ready to take their part if any alarm should startle them the girl bent over her soldier stroking his head so softly that she might have been putting him to sleep took his one hand and held it against her bosom as if to stop the pain there just behind her on the sculptured portal some old bishop with a pointed cap and a broken crozier stood holding up two fingers iii the next morning when claude arrived at the hospital to see fanning he found every one too busy to take account of him the courtyard was full of ambulances and a long line of camions waited outside the gate a trainload of wounded americans had come in sent back from evacuation hospitals to await transportation home as the men were carried past him he thought they looked as if they had been sick a long whilelooked indeed as if they could never get well the boys who died on board the anchises had never seemed as sick as these did their skin was yellow or purple their eyes were sunken their lips sore everything that belonged to health had left them every attribute of youth was gone one poor fellow whose face and trunk were wrapped in cotton never stopped moaning and as he was carried up the corridor he smelled horribly the texas orderly remarked to claude in the beginning that one only had a finger blown off would you believe it these were the first wounded men claude had seen to shed bright blood to wear the red badge of couragethat was one thing but to be reduced to this was quite another surely the sooner these boys died the better the texan passing with his next load asked claude why he didnt go into the office and wait until the rush was over looking in through the glass door claude noticed a young man writing at a desk enclosed by a railing something about his figure about the way he held his head was familiar when he lifted his left arm to prop open the page of his ledger it was a stump below the elbow yes there could be no doubt about it the pale sharp face the beak nose the frowning uneasy brow presently as if he felt a curious eye upon him the young man paused in his rapid writing wriggled his shoulders put an iron paperweight on the page of his book took a case from his pocket and shook a cigarette out on the table going up to the railing claude offered him a cigar no thank you i dont use them any more they seem too heavy for me he struck a match moved his shoulders again as if they were cramped and sat down on the edge of his desk where do these wounded men come from claude asked i just got in on the anchises yesterday they come from various evacuation hospitals i believe most of them are the belleau wood lot where did you lose your arm cantigny i was in the first division id been over since last september waiting for something to happen and then got fixed in my first engagement cant you go home yes i could but i dont want to ive got used to things over here i was attached to headquarters in paris for awhile claude leaned across the rail we read about cantigny at home of course we were a good deal excited i suppose you were yes we were nervous we hadnt been under fire and wed been fed up on all that stuff about its taking fifty years to build a fighting machine the hun had a strong position we looked up that long hill and wondered how we were going to behave as he talked the boys eyes seemed to be moving all the time probably because he could not move his head at all after blowing out deep clouds of smoke until his cigarette was gone he sat down to his ledger and frowned at the page in a way which said he was too busy to talk claude saw dr trueman standing in the doorway waiting for him they made their morning call on fanning and left the hospital together the doctor turned to him as if he had something on his mind i saw you talking to that wrynecked boy how did he seem all right not exactly that is he seems very nervous do you know anything about him oh yes hes a star patient here a psychopathic case i had just been talking to one of the doctors about him when i came out and saw you with him he was shot in the neck at cantigny where he lost his arm the wound healed but his memory is affected some nerve cut i suppose that connects with that part of his brain this psychopath phillips takes a great interest in him and keeps him here to observe him hes writing a book about him he says the fellow has forgotten almost everything about his life before he came to france the queer thing is its his recollection of women that is most affected he can remember his father but not his mother doesnt know if he has sisters or notcan remember seeing girls about the house but thinks they may have been cousins his photographs and belongings were lost when he was hurt all except a bunch of letters he had in his pocket they are from a girl hes engaged to and he declares he cant remember her at all doesnt know what she looks like or anything about her and cant remember getting engaged the doctor has the letters they seem to be from a nice girl in his own town who is very ambitious for him to make the most of himself he deserted soon after he was sent to this hospital ran away he was found on a farm out in the country here where the sons had been killed and the people had sort of adopted him hed quit his uniform and was wearing the clothes of one of the dead sons hed probably have got away with it if he hadnt had that wry neck some one saw him in the fields and recognized him and reported him i guess nobody cared much but this psychopathic doctor he wanted to get his pet patient back they call him the lost american here he seems to be doing some sort of clerical work claude observed discreetly yes they say hes very well educated he remembers the books he has read better than his own life he cant recall what his home town looks like or his home and the women are clear wiped out even the girl he was going to marry claude smiled maybe hes fortunate in that the doctor turned to him affectionately now claude dont begin to talk like that the minute you land in this country claude walked on past the church of st jacques last night already seemed like a dream but it haunted him he wished he could do something to help that boy help him get away from the doctor who was writing a book about him and the girl who wanted him to make the most of himself get away and be lost altogether in what he had been lucky enough to find all day as claude came and went he looked among the crowds for that young face so compassionate and tender iv deeper and deeper into flowery france that was the sentence claude kept saying over to himself to the jolt of the wheels as the long troop train went southward on the second day after he and his company had left the port of debarkation fields of wheat fields of oats fields of rye all the low hills and rolling uplands clad with harvest and everywhere in the grass in the yellowing grain along the roadbed the poppies spilling and streaming on the second day the boys were still calling to each other about the poppies nothing else had so entirely surpassed their expectations they had supposed that poppies grew only on battle fields or in the brains of war correspondents nobody knew what the cornflowers were except willy katz an austrian boy from the omaha packinghouses and he knew only an objectionable name for them so he offered no information for a long time they thought the red clover blossoms were wild flowersthey were as big as wild roses when they passed the first alfalfa field the whole train rang with laughter alfalfa was one thing they believed that had never been heard of outside their own prairie states all the way down company b had been finding the old things instead of the newor to their way of thinking the new things instead of the old the thatched roofs they had so counted upon seeing were few and far between but american binders of wellknown makes stood where the fields were beginning to ripenand they were being oiled and put in order not by peasants but by wiselooking old farmers who seemed to know their business pear trees trained like vines against the wall did not astonish them half so much as the sight of the familiar cottonwood growing everywhere claude thought he had never before realized how beautiful this tree could be in verdant little valleys along the clear rivers the cottonwoods waved and rustled and on the little islands of which there were so many in these rivers they stood in pointed masses seemed to grip deep into the soil and to rest easy as if they had been there for ever and would be there for ever more at home all about frankfort the farmers were cutting down their cottonwoods because they were common planting maples and ash trees to struggle along in their stead never mind the cottonwoods were good enough for france and they were good enough for him he felt they were a real bond between him and this people when b company had first got their orders to go into a training camp in north central france all the men were disappointed troops much rawer than they were being rushed to the front so why fool around any longer but now they were reconciled to the delay there seemed to be a good deal of france that wasnt the war and they wouldnt mind travelling about a little in a country like this was the harvest always a month later than at home as it seemed to be this year why did the farmers have rows of trees growing along the edges of every fielddidnt they take the strength out of the soil what did the farmers mean by raising patches of mustard right along beside other crops didnt they know that mustard got into wheat fields and strangled the grain the second night the boys were to spend in rouen and they would have the following day to look about everybody knew what had happened at rouenif any one didnt his neighbours were only too eager to inform him it had happened in the marketplace and the marketplace was what they were going to find tomorrow when it came proved to be black and cold a day of pouring rain as they filed through the narrow crowded streets that harsh norman city presented no very cheering aspect they were glad at last to find the waterside to go out on the bridge and breathe the air in the great open space over the river away from the clatter of cartwheels and the hard voices and crafty faces of these townspeople who seemed rough and unfriendly from the bridge they looked up at the white chalk hills the tops a blur of intense green under the low leadcoloured sky they watched the fleets of broad deepset river barges coming and going under their feet with tilted smokestacks only a little way up that river was paris the place where every doughboy meant to go and as they leaned on the rail and looked down at the slowflowing water each one had in his mind a confused picture of what it would be like the seine they felt sure must be very much wider there and it was spanned by many bridges all longer than the bridge over the missouri at omaha there would be spires and golden domes past counting all the buildings higher than anything in chicago and brilliantdazzlingly brilliant nothing grey and shabby about it like this old rouen they attributed to the city of their desire incalculable immensity bewildering vastness babylonian hugeness and heavinessthe only attributes they had been taught to admire late in the morning claude found himself alone before the church of st ouen he was hunting for the cathedral and this looked as if it might be the right place he shook the water from his raincoat and entered removing his hat at the door the day so dark without was darker still within far away a few scattered candles still little points of light just before him in the grey twilight slender white columns in long rows like the stems of silver poplars the entrance to the nave was closed by a cord so he walked up the aisle on the right treading softly passing chapels where solitary women knelt in the light of a few tapers except for them the church was empty empty his own breathing was audible in this silence he moved with caution lest he should wake an echo when he reached the choir he turned and saw far behind him the rose window with its purple heart as he stood staring hat in hand as still as the stone figures in the chapels a great bell up aloft began to strike the hour in its deep melodious throat eleven beats measured and far apart as rich as the colours in the window then silence only in his memory the throbbing of an undreamedof quality of sound the revelations of the glass and the bell had come almost simultaneously as if one produced the other and both were superlatives toward which his mind had always been gropingor so it seemed to him then in front of the choir the nave was open with no rope to shut it off several straw chairs were huddled on a flag of the stone floor after some hesitation he took one turned it round and sat down facing the window if some one should come up to him and say anything anything at all he would rise and say pardon monsieur je ne sais pas cest defendu he repeated this to himself to be quite sure he had it ready on the train coming down he had talked to the boys about the bad reputation americans had acquired for slouching all over the place and butting in on things and had urged them to tread lightly but lieutenant the kid from pleasantville had piped up isnt this whole expedition a buttin after all it aint our war claude laughed but he told him he meant to make an example of the fellow who went to roughhousing he was well satisfied that he hadnt his restless companions on his mind now he could sit here quietly until noon and hear the bell strike again in the meantime he must try to think this was of course gothic architecture he had read more or less about that and ought to be able to remember something gothic that was a mere word to him it suggested something very peaked and pointedsharp arches steep roofs it had nothing to do with these slim white columns that rose so straight and faror with the window burning up there in its vault of gloom while he was vainly trying to think about architecture some recollection of old astronomy lessons brushed across his brainsomething about stars whose light travels through space for hundreds of years before it reaches the earth and the human eye the purple and crimson and peacockgreen of this window had been shining quite as long as that before it got to him he felt distinctly that it went through him and farther still as if his mother were looking over his shoulder he sat solemnly through the hour until twelve his elbows on his knees his conical hat swinging between them in his hand looking up through the twilight with candid thoughtful eyes when claude joined his company at the station they had the laugh on him they had found the cathedraland a statue of richard the lionhearted over the spot where the lionheart itself was buried the identical organ fat sergeant hicks assured him but they were all glad to leave rouen v b company reached the training camp at s thirtysix men short twentyfive they had buried on the voyage over and eleven sick were left at the base hospital the company was to be attached to a battalion which had already seen service commanded by lieutenant colonel scott arriving early in the morning the officers reported at once to headquarters captain maxey must have suffered a shock when the colonel rose from his desk to acknowledge his salute then shook hands with them all around and asked them about their journey the colonel was not a very martial figure short fat with slouching shoulders and a lumpy back like a sack of potatoes though he wasnt much over forty he was bald and his collar would easily slip over his head without being unbuttoned his little twinkling eyes and goodhumoured face were without a particle of arrogance or official dignity years ago when general pershing then a handsome young lieutenant with a slender waist and yellow moustaches was stationed as commandant at the university of nebraska walter scott was an officer in a company of cadets the lieutenant took about to military tournaments the pershing rifles they were called and they won prizes wherever they went after his graduation scott settled down to running a hardware business in a thriving nebraska town and sold gas ranges and garden hose for twenty years about the time pershing was sent to the mexican border scott began to think there might eventually be something in the wind and that he would better get into training he went down to texas with the national guard he had come to france with the first division and had won his promotions by solid soldierly qualities i see youre an officer short captain maxey the colonel remarked at their conference i think ive got a man here to take his place lieutenant gerhardt is a new york man came over in the band and got transferred to infantry he has lately been given a commission for good service hes had some experience and is a capable fellow the colonel sent his orderly out to bring in a young man whom he introduced to the officers as lieutenant david gerhardt claude had been ashamed of tod fanning who was always showing himself a saphead and who would never have got a commission if his uncle hadnt been a congressman but the moment he met lieutenant gerhardts eye something like jealousy flamed up in him he felt in a flash that he suffered by comparison with the new officer that he must be on his guard and must not let himself be patronized as they were leaving the colonels office together gerhardt asked him whether he had got his billet claude replied that after the men were in their quarters he would look out for something for himself the young man smiled im afraid you may have difficulty the people about here have been overworked keeping soldiers and they are not willing as they once were im with a nice old couple over in the village im almost sure i can get you in there if youll come along well speak to them before some one else is put off on them claude didnt want to go didnt want to accept favoursnevertheless he went they walked together along a dusty road that ran between halfripe wheat fields bordered with poplar trees the wild morningglories and queen annes lace that grew by the roadside were still shining with dew a fresh breeze stirred the bearded grain parting it in furrows and fanning out streaks of crimson poppies the new officer was not intrusive certainly he walked along whistling softly to himself seeming quite lost in the freshness of the morning or in his own thoughts there had been nothing patronizing in his manner so far and claude began to wonder why he felt ill at ease with him perhaps it was because he did not look like the rest of them though he was young he did not look boyish he seemed experienced a finished product rather than something on the way he was handsome and his face like his manner and his walk had something distinguished about it a broad white forehead under reddish brown hair hazel eyes with no uncertainty in their look an aquiline nose finely cuta sensitive scornful mouth which somehow did not detract from the kindly though slightly reserved expression of his face lieutenant gerhardt must have been in this neighbourhood for some time he seemed to know the people on the road they passed several villagers a rough looking girl taking a cow out to graze an old man with a basket on his arm the postman on his bicycle they all spoke to claudes companion as if they knew him well what are these blue flowers that grow about everywhere claude asked suddenly pointing to a clump with his foot cornflowers said the other the germans call them kaiserblumen they were approaching the village which lay on the edge of a wooda wood so large one could not see the end of it it met the horizon with a ridge of pines the village was but a single street on either side ran claycoloured walls with painted wooden doors here and there and green shutters claudes guide opened one of these gates and they walked into a little sanded garden the house was built round it on three sides under a cherry tree sat a woman in a black dress sewing a work table beside her she was fifty perhaps but though her hair was grey she had a look of youthfulness thin cheeks delicately flushed with pink and quiet smiling intelligent eyes claude thought she looked like a new england womanlike the photographs of his mothers cousins and schoolmates lieutenant gerhardt introduced him to madame joubert he was quite disheartened by the colloquy that followed clearly his new fellow officer spoke madame jouberts perplexing language as readily as she herself did and he felt irritated and grudging as he listened he had been hoping that wherever he stayed he could learn to talk to the people a little but with this accomplished young man about he would never have the courage to try he could see that mme joubert liked gerhardt liked him very much and all this for some reason discouraged him gerhardt turned to claude speaking in a way which included madame joubert in the conversation though she could not understand it madame joubert will let you come although she has done her part and really doesnt have to take any one else in but you will be so well off here that im glad she consents you will have to share my room but there are two beds she will show you gerhardt went out of the gate and left him alone with his hostess her mind seemed to read his thoughts when he uttered a word or any sound that resembled one she quickly and smoothly made a sentence of it as if she were quite accustomed to talking in this way and expected only monosyllables from strangers she was kind even a little playful with him but he felt it was all good manners and that underneath she was not thinking of him at all when he was alone in the tilefloored sleeping room upstairs unrolling his blankets and arranging his shaving things he looked out of the window and watched her where she sat sewing under the cherry tree she had a very sad face he thought it wasnt grief nothing sharp and definite like sorrow it was an old quiet impersonal sadnesssweet in its expression like the sadness of music as he came out of the house to start back to the barracks he bowed to her and tried to say au revoir madame jusq au ce soir he stopped near the kitchen door to look at a manybranched rose vine that ran all over the wall full of creamcoloured pinktipped roses just a shade stronger in colour than the clay wall behind them madame joubert came over and stood beside him looking at him and at the rosier oui cest joli nestce pas she took the scissors that hung by a ribbon from her belt cut one of the flowers and stuck it in his buttonhole voilà she made a little flourish with her thin hand stepping into the street he turned to shut the wooden door after him and heard a soft stir in the dark toolhouse at his elbow from among the rakes and spades a childs frightened face was staring out at him she was sitting on the ground with her lap full of baby kittens he caught but a glimpse of her dull pale face vi the next morning claude awoke with such a sense of physical wellbeing as he had not had for a long time the sun was shining brightly on the white plaster walls and on the red tiles of the floor green jalousies halfdrawn shaded the upper part of the two windows through their slats he could see the forking branches of an old locust tree that grew by the gate a flock of pigeons flew over it dipping and mounting with a sharp twinkle of silver wings it was good to lie again in a house that was cared for by women he must have felt that even in his sleep for when he opened his eyes he was thinking about mahailey and breakfast and summer mornings on the farm the early stillness was sweet and the feeling of dry clean linen against his body there was a smell of lavender about his warm pillow he lay still for fear of waking lieutenant gerhardt this was the sort of peace one wanted to enjoy alone when he rose cautiously on his elbow and looked at the other bed it was empty his companion must have dressed and slipped out when day first broke somebody else who liked to enjoy things alone that looked hopeful but now that he had the place to himself he decided to get up while he was dressing he could see old m joubert down in the garden watering the plants and vines raking the sand fresh and smooth clipping off dead leaves and withered flowers and throwing them into a wheelbarrow these people had lost both their sons in the war he had been told and now they were taking care of the property for their grandchildrentwo daughters of the elder son claude saw gerhardt come into the garden and sit down at the table under the trees where they had their dinner last night he hurried down to join him gerhardt made room for him on the bench do you always sleep like that its an accomplishment i made enough noise when i dressedkept dropping things but it never reached you madame joubert came out of the kitchen in a purple flowered morning gown her hair in curlpapers under a lace cap she brought the coffee herself and they sat down at the unpainted table without a cloth and drank it out of big crockery bowls they had fresh milk with itthe first claude had tasted in a long while and sugar which gerhardt produced from his pocket the old cook had her coffee sitting in the kitchen door and on the step at her feet sat the strange pale little girl madame joubert amiably addressed herself to claude she knew that americans were accustomed to a different sort of morning repast and if he wished to bring bacon from the camp she would gladly cook it for him she had even made pancakes for officers who stayed there before she seemed pleased however to learn that claude had had enough of these things for awhile she called david by his first name pronouncing it the french way and when claude said he hoped she would do as much for him she said oh yes that his was a very good french name mais un peu un peu romanesque at which he blushed not quite knowing whether she were making fun of him or not it is rather so in english isnt it david asked well its a sissy name if you mean that yes it is a little david admitted candidly the days work on the parade ground was hard and captain maxeys men were soft felt the heatdidnt size up well with the kansas boys who had been hardened by service the colonel wasnt pleased with b company and detailed them to build new barracks and extend the sanitation system claude got out and worked with the men gerhardt followed his example but it was easy to see that he had never handled lumber or tinroofing before a kind of rivalry seemed to have sprung up between him and claude neither of them knew why claude could see that the sergeants and corporals were a little uncertain about gerhardt his laconic speech never embroidered by the picturesque slang they relished his gravity and his rare incredulous smile alike puzzled them was the new officer a dude sergeant hicks asked of his chum dell able no he wasnt a dude was he a swellhead no not at all but he wasnt a good mixer he was an easterner what more he was would develop later claude sensed something unusual about him he suspected that gerhardt knew a good many things as well as he knew french and that he tried to conceal it as people sometimes do when they feel they are not among their equals this idea nettled him it was claude who seized the opportunity to be patronizing when gerhardt betrayed that he was utterly unable to select lumber by given measurements the next afternoon work on the new barracks was called off because of rain sergeant hicks set about getting up a boxing match but when he went to invite the lieutenants they had both disappeared claude was tramping toward the village determined to get into the big wood that had tempted him ever since his arrival the highroad became the village street and then at the edge of the wood became a country road again a little farther on where the shade grew denser it split up into three wagon trails two of them faint and little used one of these claude followed the rain had dwindled to a steady patter but the tall brakes growing up in the path splashed him to the middle and his feet sank in spongy mossy earth the light about him the very air was green the trunks of the trees were overgrown with a soft green moss like mould he was wondering whether this forest was not always a damp gloomy place when suddenly the sun broke through and shattered the whole wood with gold he had never seen anything like the quivering emerald of the moss the silky green of the dripping beech tops everything woke up rabbits ran across the path birds began to sing and all at once the brakes were full of whirring insects the winding path turned again and came out abruptly on a hillside above an open glade piled with grey boulders on the opposite rise of ground stood a grove of pines with bare red stems the light around and under them was red like a rosy sunset nearly all the stems divided about halfway up into two great arms which came together again at the top like the pictures of old grecian lyres down in the grassy glade among the piles of flint boulders little white birches shook out their shining leaves in the lightly moving air all about the rocks were patches of purple heath it ran up into the crevices between them like fire on one of these bald rocks sat lieutenant gerhardt hatless in an attitude of fatigue or of deep dejection his hands clasped about his knees his bronze hair ruddy in the sun after watching him for a few minutes claude descended the slope swishing the tall ferns will i be in the way he asked as he stopped at the foot of the rocks oh no said the other moving a little and unclasping his hand claude sat down on a boulder is this heather he asked i thought i recognized it from kidnapped this part of the world is not as new to you as it is to me no i lived in paris for several years when i was a student what were you studying the violin you are a musician claude looked at him wonderingly i was replied the other with a disdainful smile languidly stretching out his legs in the heather that seems too bad claude remarked gravely what does why to take fellows with a special talent there are enough of us who havent any gerhardt rolled over on his back and put his hands under his head oh this affair is too big for exceptions its universal if you happened to be born twentysix years ago you couldnt escape if this war didnt kill you in one way it would in another he told claude he had trained at camp dix and had come over eight months ago in a regimental band but he hated the work he had to do and got transferred to the infantry when they retraced their steps the wood was full of green twilight their relations had changed somewhat during the last half hour and they strolled in confidential silence up the homelike street to the door of their own garden since the rain was over madame joubert had laid the cloth on the plank table under the cherry tree as on the previous evenings monsieur was bringing the chairs and the little girl was carrying out a pile of heavy plates she rested them against her stomach and leaned back as she walked to balance them she wore shoes but no stockings and her faded cotton dress switched about her brown legs she was a little belgian refugee who had been sent there with her mother the mother was dead now and the child would not even go to visit her grave she could not be coaxed from the courtyard into the quiet street if the neighbour children came into the garden on an errand she hid herself she would have no playmates but the cat and now she had the kittens in the tool house dinner was very cheerful that evening m joubert was pleased that the storm had not lasted long enough to hurt the wheat the garden was fresh and bright after the rain the cherry tree shook down bright drops on the tablecloth when the breeze stirred the mother cat dozed on the red cushion in madame jouberts sewing chair and the pigeons fluttered down to snap up earthworms that wriggled in the wet sand the shadow of the house fell over the dinnertable but the treetops stood up in full sunlight and the yellow sun poured on the earth wall and the creamcoloured roses their petals ruffled by the rain gave out a wet spicy smell m joubert must have been ten years older than his wife there was a great contentment in his manner and a pleasant sparkle in his eye he liked the young officers gerhardt had been there more than two weeks and somewhat relieved the stillness that had settled over the house since the second son died in hospital the jouberts had dropped out of things they had done all they could do given all they had and now they had nothing to look forward toexcept the event to which all france looked forward the father was talking to gerhardt about the great seaport the americans were making of bordeaux he said he meant to go there after the war to see it all for himself madame joubert was pleased to hear that they had been walking in the wood and was the heather in bloom she wished they had brought her some next time they went perhaps she used to walk there often her eyes seemed to come nearer to them claude thought when she spoke of it and she evidently cared a great deal more about what was blooming in the wood than about what the americans were doing on the garonne he wished he could talk to her as gerhardt did he admired the way she roused herself and tried to interest them speaking her difficult language with such spirit and precision it was a language that couldnt be mumbled that had to be spoken with energy and fire or not spoken at all merely speaking that exacting tongue would help to rally a broken spirit he thought the little maid who served them moved about noiselessly her dull eyes never seemed to look yet she saw when it was time to bring the heavy soup tureen and when it was time to take it away madame joubert had found that claude liked his potatoes with his meatwhen there was meatand not in a course by themselves she had each time to tell the little girl to go and fetch them this the child did with manifest reluctancesullenly as if she were being forced to do something wrong she was a very strange little creature altogether as the two soldiers left the table and started for the camp claude reached down into the tool house and took up one of the kittens holding it out in the light to see it blink its eyes the little girl just coming out of the kitchen uttered a shrill scream a really terrible scream and squatted down covering her face with her hands madame joubert came out to chide her what is the matter with that child claude asked as they hurried out of the gate do you suppose she was hurt or abused in some way terrorized she often screams like that at night havent you heard her they have to go and wake her to stop it she doesnt speak any french only walloon and she cant or wont learn so they cant tell what goes on in her poor little head in the two weeks of intensive training that followed claude marvelled at gerhardts spirit and endurance the muscular strain of mimic trench operations was more of a tax on him than on any of the other officers he was as tall as claude but he weighed only a hundred and fortysix pounds and he had not been roughly bred like most of the others when his fellow officers learned that he was a violinist by profession that he could have had a soft job as interpreter or as an organizer of camp entertainments they no longer resented his reserve or his occasional superciliousness they respected a man who could have wriggled out and didnt vii on the march at last through a brilliant august day colonel scotts battalion was streaming along one of the dusty wellworn roads east of the somme their railway base well behind them the way led through rolling country fields hills woods little villages shattered but still habitable where the people came out to watch the soldiers go by the americans went through every village in march step colours flying the band playing to show that the morale was high as the officers said claude trudged on the outside of the columnnow at the front of his company now at the rearwearing a stoical countenance afraid of betraying his satisfaction in the men the weather the country they were bound for the big show and on every hand were reassuring signs long lines of gaunt dead trees charred and torn big holes gashed out in fields and hillsides already half concealed by new undergrowth winding depressions in the earth bodies of wrecked motortrucks and automobiles lying along the road and everywhere endless straggling lines of rusty barbedwire that seemed to have been put there by chancewith no purpose at all begins to look like were getting in lieutenant said sergeant hicks smiling behind his salute claude nodded and passed forward well we cant arrive any too soon for us boys the sergeant looked over his shoulder and they grinned their teeth flashing white in their red perspiring faces claude didnt wonder that everybody along the route even the babies came out to see them he thought they were the finest sight in the world this was the first day they had worn their tin hats gerhardt had shown them how to stuff grass and leaves inside to keep their heads cool when they fell into fours and the band struck up as they approached a town bert fuller the boy from pleasantville on the platte who had blubbered on the voyage over was guide right and whenever claude passed him his face seemed to say you wont get anything on me in a hurry lieutenant they made camp early in the afternoon on a hill covered with halfburned pines claude took bert and dell able and oscar the swede and set off to make a survey and report the terrain behind the hill under the burned edge of the wood they found an abandoned farmhouse and what seemed to be a clean well it had a solid stone curb about it and a wooden bucket hanging by a rusty wire when the boys splashed the bucket about the water sent up a pure cool breath but they were wise boys and knew where dead prussians most loved to hide even the straw in the stable they regarded with suspicion and thought it would be just as well not to bed anybody there swinging on to the right to make their circuit they got into mud a low field where the drain ditches had been neglected and had overflowed there they came upon a pitiful group of humanity bemired a woman ill and wretched looking sat on a fallen log at the end of the marsh a baby in her lap and three children hanging about her she was far gone in consumption one had only to listen to her breathing and to look at her white perspiring face to feel how weak she was draggled mud to the knees she was trying to nurse her baby half hidden under an old black shawl she didnt look like a tramp woman but like one who had once been able to take proper care of herself and she was still young the children were tired and discouraged one little boy wore a clumsy blue jacket made from a french army coat the other wore a battered american stetson that came down over his ears he carried in his two arms a pink celluloid clock they all looked up and waited for the soldiers to do something claude approached the woman and touching the rim of his helmet began bonjour madame quest que cest she tried to speak but went off into a spasm of coughing only able to gasp toinette toinette toinette stepped quickly forward she was about eleven and seemed to be the captain of the party a bold hard little face with a long chin straight black hair tied with rags uneasy crafty eyes she looked much less gentle and more experienced than her mother she began to explain and she was very clever at making herself understood she was used to talking to foreign soldiersspoke slowly with emphasis and ingenious gestures she too had been reconnoitering she had discovered the empty farmhouse and was trying to get her party there for the night how did they come here oh they were refugees they had been staying with people thirty kilometers from here they were trying to get back to their own village her mother was very sick presque morte and she wanted to go home to die they had heard people were still living there an old aunt was living in their own cellarand so could they if they once got there the point was and she made it over and over that her mother wished to die chez elle comprenezvous they had no papers and the french soldiers would never let them pass but now that the americans were here they hoped to get through the americans were said to be toujours gentils while she talked in her shrill clicking voice the baby began to howl dissatisfied with its nourishment the little girl shrugged il est toujours en colère she muttered the woman turned it around with difficultyit seemed a big heavy baby but white and sicklyand gave it the other breast it began sucking her noisily rooting and sputtering as if it were famished it was too painful it was almost indecent to see this exhausted woman trying to feed her baby claude beckoned his men away to one side and taking the little girl by the hand drew her after them il faut que votre mèrese reposer he told her with the grave caesural pause which he always made in the middle of a french sentence she understood him no distortion of her native tongue surprised or perplexed her she was accustomed to being addressed in all persons numbers genders tenses by germans english americans she only listened to hear whether the voice was kind and with men in this uniform it usually was kind had they anything to eat vous avez quelque chose à manger rien rien du tout wasnt her mother trop malade à marcher she shrugged monsieur could see for himself and her father he was dead mort à la marne en quatorze at the marne claude repeated glancing in perplexity at the nursing baby her sharp eyes followed his and she instantly divined his doubt the baby she said quickly oh the baby is not my brother he is a boche for a moment claude did not understand she repeated her explanation impatiently something disdainful and sinister in her metallic little voice a slow blush mounted to his forehead he pushed her toward her mother attendez là i guess well have to get them over to that farmhouse he told the men he repeated what he had got of the childs story when he came to her laconic statement about the baby they looked at each other bert fuller was afraid he might cry again so he kept muttering by god if wed agot here sooner by god if we had as they ran back along the ditch dell and oscar made a chair of their crossed hands and carried the woman she was no great weight bert picked up the little boy with the pink clock come along little frog your legs aint long enough claude walked behind holding the screaming baby stiffly in his arms how was it possible for a baby to have such definite personality he asked himself and how was it possible to dislike a baby so much he hated it for its square towthatched head and bloodless ears and carried it with loathing no wonder it cried when it got nothing by screaming and stiffening however it suddenly grew quiet regarded him with pale blue eyes and tried to make itself comfortable against his khaki coat it put out a grimy little fist and took hold of one of his buttons kamerad eh he muttered glaring at the infant cut it out before they had their own supper that night the boys carried hot food and blankets down to their family viii four oclock a summer dawn his first morning in the trenches claude had just been along the line to see that the gun teams were in position this hour when the light was changing was a favourite time for attack he had come in late last night and had everything to learn mounting the firestep he peeped over the parapet between the sandbags into the low twisting mist just then he could see nothing but the wire entanglement with birds hopping along the top wire singing and chirping as they did on the wire fences at home clear and flutelike they sounded in the heavy airand they were the only sounds a little breeze came up slowly clearing the mist away streaks of green showed through the moving banks of vapour the birds became more agitated that dull stretch of grey and green was no mans land those low zigzag mounds like giant molehills protected by wire hurdles were the hun trenches five or six lines of them he could easily follow the communication trenches without a glass at one point their front line could not be more than eighty yards away at another it must be all of three hundred here and there thin columns of smoke began to rise the hun was getting breakfast everything was comfortable and natural behind the enemys position the country rose gradually for several miles with ravines and little woods where according to his map they had masked artillery back on the hills were ruined farmhouses and broken trees but nowhere a living creature in sight it was a dead nerveless countryside sunk in quiet and dejection yet everywhere the ground was full of men their own trenches from the other side must look quite as dead life was a secret these days it was amazing how simply things could be done his battalion had marched in quietly at midnight and the line they came to relieve had set out as silently for the rear it all took place in utter darkness just as b company slid down an incline into the shallow rear trenches the country was lit for a moment by two star shells there was a rattling of machine guns german maximsa sporadic crackle that was not followed up filing along the communication trenches they listened anxiously artillery fire would have made it bad for the other men who were marching to the rear but nothing happened they had a quiet night and this morning here they were the sky flamed up saffron and silver claude looked at his watch but he could not bear to go just yet how long it took a wheeler to get round to anything four years on the way now that he was here he would enjoy the scenery a bit he guessed he wished his mother could know how he felt this morning but perhaps she did know at any rate she would not have him anywhere else five years ago when he was sitting on the steps of the denver state house and knew that nothing unexpected could ever happen to him suppose he could have seen in a flash where he would be today he cast a long look at the reddening lengthening landscape and dropped down on the duckboard claude made his way back to the dugout into which he and gerhardt had thrown their effects last night the former occupants had left it clean there were two bunks nailed against the side wallswooden frames with wire netting over them covered with dry sandbags between the two bunks was a soapbox table with a candle stuck in a green bottle an alcohol stove a bainmarie and two tin cups on the wall were coloured pictures from jugend taken out of some hun trench he found gerhardt still asleep on his bed and shook him until he sat up how long have you been out claude didnt you sleep a little i wasnt very tired i suppose we could heat shaving water on this stove theyve left us half a bottle of alcohol its quite a comfortable little hole isnt it it will doubtless serve its purpose david remarked dryly so sensitive to any criticism of this war why its not your affair youve only just arrived i know claude replied meekly as he began to fold his blankets but its likely the only one ill ever be in so i may as well take an interest the next afternoon four young men all more or less naked were busy about a shellhole full of opaque brown water sergeant hicks and his chum dell able had hunted through half the blazing hot morning to find a hole not too scummy conveniently and even picturesquely situated and had reported it to the lieutenants captain maxey hicks said could send his own orderly to find his own shellhole and could take his bath in private hed never wash himself with anybody else the sergeant added afraid of exposing his dignity bruger and hammond the two second lieutenants were already out of their bath and reclined on what might almost be termed a grassy slope examining various portions of their body with interest they hadnt had all their clothes off for some time and four days of marching in hot weather made a man anxious to look at himself you wait till winter gerhardt told them he was still splashing in the hole up to his armpits in muddy water you wont get a wash once in three months then some of the tommies told me that when they got their first bath after vimy their skins peeled off like a snakes what are you doing with my trousers bruger hunting for your knife i dropped mine yesterday when that shell exploded in the cutoff i darned near dropped my old nut shucks that wasnt anything dont keep blowing about itshows youre a greenhorn claude stripped off his shirt and slid into the pool beside gerhardt gee i hit something sharp down there why didnt you fellows pull out the splinters he shut his eyes disappeared for a moment and came up sputtering throwing on the ground a round metal object coated with rust and full of slime german helmet isnt it phew he wiped his face and looked about suspiciously phew is right bruger turned the object over with a stick why in hell didnt you bring up the rest of him youve spoiled my bath i hope you enjoy it gerhardt scrambled up the side get out wheeler look at that he pointed to big sleepy bubbles bursting up through the thick water youve stirred up trouble all right somethings going very bad down there claude got out after him looking back at the activity in the water i dont see how pulling out one helmet could stir the bottom up so i should think the water would keep the smell down ever study chemistry bruger asked scornfully you just opened up a graveyard and now we get the exhaust if you swallowed any of that german cologneoh you should worry lieutenant hammond still barelegged with his shirt tied over his shoulders was scratching in his notebook before they left he put up a placard on a split stick no public bathing private beach c wheeler co b 2th infty the first letters from home the supply wagons brought them up and every man in the company got something except ed drier a farmhand from the nebraska sand hills and willy katz the towheaded austrian boy from the south omaha packinghouses their comrades were sorry for them ed didnt have any folks of his own but he had expected letters all the same willy was sure his mother must have written when the last ragged envelope was given out and he turned away emptyhanded he murmured shes bohunk and she dont write so good i guess the address wasnt plain and some fellow in another compny has got my letter no second class matter was sent upthe boys had hoped for newspapers from home to give them a little war news since they never got any here dell ables sister however had enclosed a clipping from the kansas city star a long account by one of the british war correspondents in mesopotamia describing the hardships the soldiers suffered there dysentery flies mosquitoes unimaginable heat he read this article aloud to a group of his friends as they sat about a shellhole pool where they had been washing their socks he had just finished the story of how the tommies had found a few mud huts at the place where the original garden of eden was said to have beena desolate spot full of stinging insectswhen oscar petersen a very religious swedish boy who was often silent for days together opened his mouth and said scornfully thats a lie dell looked up at him annoyed by the interruption how do you know it is because the lord put four cherubims with swords to guard the garden and there aint no man going to find it it aint intended they should the bible says so hicks began to laugh why that was about six thousand years ago you cheese do you suppose your cherubims are still there course they are whats a thousand years to a cherubim nothin the swede rose and sullenly gathered up his socks dell able looked at his chum aint he the complete bonehead solid ivory oscar wouldnt listen further to a pack of lies and walked off with his washing battalion headquarters was nearly half a mile behind the front line part dugout part shed with a plank roof sodded over the colonels office was partitioned off at one end the rest of the place he gave over to the officers for a kind of club room one night claude went back to make a report on the new placing of the gun teams the young officers were sitting about on soap boxes smoking and eating sweet crackers out of tin cases gerhardt was working at a plank table with paper and crayons making a clean copy of a rough map they had drawn up together that morning showing the limits of fire noise didnt fluster him he could sit among a lot of men and write as calmly as if he were alone there was one officer who could talk all the others down wherever he was captain barclay owens attached from the engineers he was a little stumpy thumb of a man only five feet four and very broada dynamo of energy before the war he was building a dam in spain the largest dam in the world and in his excavations he had discovered the ruins of one of julius caesars fortified camps this had been too much for his easilyinflamed imagination he photographed and measured and brooded upon these ancient remains he was an engineer by day and an archaeologist by night he had crates of books sent down from pariseverything that had been written on caesar in french and german he engaged a young priest to translate them aloud to him in the evening the priest believed the american was mad when owens was in college he had never shown the least interest in classical studies but now it was as if he were giving birth to caesar the war came along and stopped the work on his dam it also drove other ideas into his exclusively engineering brains he rushed home to kansas to explain the war to his countrymen he travelled about the west demonstrating exactly what had happened at the first battle of the marne until he had a chance to enlist in the battalion owens was called julius caesar and the men never knew whether he was explaining the roman generals operations in spain or joffres at the marne he jumped so from one to the other everything was in the foreground with him centuries made no difference nothing existed until barclay owens found out about it the men liked to hear him talk tonight he was walking up and down his yellow eyes rolling a big black cigar in his hand lecturing the young officers upon french characteristics coaching and preparing them it was his legs that made him so funny his trunk was that of a big man set on two short stumps now you fellows dont want to forget that the nightlife of paris is not a typical thing at all thats a show got up for foreigners the french peasant hes a thrifty fellow this red wines all right if you dont abuse it take it twothirds water and it keeps off dysentery you dont have to be rough with them simply firm whenever one of them accosts me i follow a regular plan first i give her twentyfive francs then i look her in the eye and say my girl ive got three children three boys she gets the point at once never fails she goes away ashamed of herself but thats so expensive it must keep you poor captain owens said young lieutenant hammond innocently the others roared claude knew that david particularly detested captain owens of the engineers and wondered that he could go on working with such concentration when snatches of the captains lecture kept breaking through the confusion of casual talk and the noise of the phonograph owens as he walked up and down cast furtive glances at gerhardt he had got wind of the fact that there was something out of the ordinary about him the men kept the phonograph going as soon as one record buzzed out somebody put in another once when a new tune began claude saw david look up from his paper with a curious expression he listened for a moment with a halfcontemptuous smile then frowned and began sketching in his map again something about his momentary glance of recognition made claude wonder whether he had particular associations with the airmelancholy but beautiful claude thought he got up and went over to change the record himself this time he took out the disk and holding it up to the light read the inscription meditation from thaisviolin solodavid gerhardt when they were going back along the communication trench in the rain wading single file claude broke the silence abruptly that was one of your records they played tonight that violin solo wasnt it sounded like it now we go to the right i always get lost here are there many of your records quite a number why do you ask id like to write my mother shes fond of good music shell get your records and it will sort of bring the whole thing closer to her dont you see all right claude said david goodnaturedly she will find them in the catalogue with my picture in uniform alongside i had a lot made before i went out to camp dix my own mother gets a little income from them here we are at home as he struck a match two black shadows jumped from the table and disappeared behind the blankets plenty of them around these wet nights get one dont squash him in there heres the sack gerhardt held open the mouth of a gunny sack and claude thrust the squirming corner of his blanket into it and vigorously trampled whatever fell to the bottom where do you suppose the other is hell join us later i dont mind the rats half so much as i do barclay owens what a sight he would be with his clothes off turn in ill go the rounds gerhardt splashed out along the submerged duckboard claude took off his shoes and cooled his feet in the muddy water he wished he could ever get david to talk about his profession and wondered what he looked like on a concert platform playing his violin ix the following night claude was sent back to division headquarters at q with information the colonel did not care to commit to paper he set off at ten oclock with sergeant hicks for escort there had been two days of rain and the communication trenches were almost kneedeep in water about half a mile back of the front line the two men crawled out of the ditch and went on above ground there was very little shelling along the front that night when a flare went up they dropped and lay on their faces trying at the same time to get a squint at what was ahead of them the ground was rough and the darkness thick it was past midnight when they reached the eastandwest roadusually full of traffic and not entirely deserted even on a night like this trains of horses were splashing through the mud with shells on their backs empty supply wagons were coming back from the front claude and hicks paused by the ditch hoping to get a ride the rain began to fall with such violence that they looked about for shelter stumbling this way and that they ran into a big artillery piece the wheels sunk over the hubs in a mudhole whos there called a quick voice unmistakably british american infantrymen two of us can we get onto one of your trucks till this lets up oh certainly we can make room for you in here if youre not too big speak quietly or youll waken the major giggles and smothered laughter a flashlight winked for a moment and showed a line of five trucks the front and rear ones covered with tarpaulin tents the voices came from the shelter next the gun the men inside drew up their legs and made room for the strangers said they were sorry they hadnt anything dry to offer them except a little rum the intruders accepted this gratefully the britishers were a giggly lot and claude thought from their voices they must all be very young they joked about their major as if he were their schoolmaster there wasnt room enough on the truck for anybody to lie down so they sat with their knees under their chins and exchanged gossip the gun team belonged to an independent battery that was sent about over the country wherever needed the rest of the battery had got through gone on to the east but this big gun was always getting into trouble now something had gone wrong with her tractor and they couldnt pull her out they called her jenny and said she was taken with fainting fits now and then and had to be humoured it was like going about with your grandmother one of the invisible tommies said she is such a pompous old thing the major was asleep on the rear truck he was going to get the vc for sleeping more giggles no they hadnt any idea where they were going of course the officers knew but artillery officers never told anything what was this country like anyhow they were new to this part had just come down from verdure claude said he had a friend in the air service up there did they happen to know anything about victor morse morse the american ace hadnt he heard why that got into the london papers morse was shot down inside the hun line three weeks ago it was a brilliant affair he was chased by eight boche planes brought down three of them put the rest to flight and was making for base when they turned and got him his machine came down in flames and he jumped fell a thousand feet or more then i suppose he never got his leave claude asked they didnt know he got a fine citation the men settled down to wait for the weather to improve or the night to pass some of them fell into a doze but claude felt wide awake he was wondering about the flat in chelsea whether the heavyeyed beauty had been very sorry or whether she was playing roses of picardy for other young officers he thought mournfully that he would never go to london now he had quite counted on meeting victor there some day after the kaiser had been properly disposed of he had really liked victor there was something about that fellow a sort of debauched baby he was who went seeking his enemy in the clouds what other age could have produced such a figure that was one of the things about this war it took a little fellow from a little town gave him an air and a swagger a life like a moviefilmand then a death like the rebel angels a man like gerhardt for instance had always lived in a more or less rosecolored world he belonged over here really how could he know what hard moulds and crusts the big guns had broken open on the other side of the sea who could ever make him understand how far it was from the strawberry bed and the glass cage in the bank to the skyroads over verdure by three oclock the rain had stopped claude and hicks set off again accompanied by one of the gun team who was going back to get help for their tractor as it began to grow light the two americans wondered more and more at the extremely youthful appearance of their companion when they stopped at a shellhole and washed the mud from their faces the english boy with his helmet off and the weather stains removed showed a countenance of adolescent freshness almost girlish cheeks like pink apples yellow curls above his forehead long soft lashes you havent been over very long have you claude asked in a fatherly tone as they took the road again i came out in sixteen i was formerly in the infantry the americans liked to hear him talk he spoke very quickly in a high piping voice how did you come to change oh i belonged to one of the pal battalions and we got cut to pieces when i came out of hospital i thought id try another branch of the service seeing my pals were gone now just what is a pal battalion drawled hicks he hated all english words he didnt understand though he didnt mind french ones in the least fellows who signed up together from school the lad piped hicks glanced at claude they both thought this boy ought to be in school for some time yet and wondered what he looked like when he first came over and you got cut up you say he asked sympathetically yes on the somme we had rotten luck we were sent over to take a trench and couldnt we didnt even get to the wire the hun was so well prepared that time we couldnt manage it we went over a thousand and we came back seventeen a hundred and seventeen no seventeen hicks whistled and again exchanged looks with claude they could neither of them doubt him there was something very unpleasant about the idea of a thousand freshfaced schoolboys being sent out against the guns it must have been a fool order he commented suppose there was some mistake at headquarters oh no headquarters knew what it was about wed have taken it if wed had any sort of luck but the hun happened to be full of fight his machine guns did for us you were hit yourself claude asked him in the leg he was popping away at me all the while but i wriggled back on my tummy when i came out of the hospital my leg wasnt strong and theres less marching in the artillery i should think youd have had about enough oh a fellow cant stay out after all his chums have been killed hed think about it all the time you know the boy replied in his clear treble claude and hicks got into headquarters just as the cooks were turning out to build their fires one of the corporals took them to the officers batha shed with big tin tubs and carried away their uniforms to dry them in the kitchen it would be an hour before the officers would be about he said and in the meantime he would manage to get clean shirts and socks for them say lieutenant hicks brought out as he was rubbing himself down with a real bath towel i dont want to hear any more about those pal battalions do you it gets my goat so long as we were going to get into this we might have been a little more previous i hate to feel small guess well have to take our medicine claude said dryly there wasnt anywhere to duck was there i felt like it nice little kid i dont believe american boys ever seem as young as that why if you met him anywhere else youd be afraid of using bad words before him hes so pretty whats the use of sending an orphan asylum out to be slaughtered i cant see it grumbled the fat sergeant well its their business im not going to let it spoil my breakfast suppose well draw ham and eggs lieutenant x after breakfast claude reported to headquarters and talked with one of the staff majors he was told he would have to wait until tomorrow to see colonel james who had been called to paris for a general conference he had left in his car at four that morning in response to a telephone message theres not much to do here by way of amusement said the major a movie show tonight and you can get anything you want at the estaminetthe one on the square opposite the english tank is the best there are a couple of nice frenchwomen in the red cross barrack up on the hill in the old convent garden they try to look out for the civilian population and were on good terms with them we get their supplies through with our own and the quartermaster has orders to help them when they run short you might go up and call on them they speak english perfectly claude asked whether he could walk in on them without any kind of introduction oh yes theyre used to us ill give you a card to mlle olive though shes a particular friend of mine there you are mlle olive de courcy introducing etc and you understand here he glanced up and looked claude over from head to foot shes a perfect lady even with an introduction claude felt some hesitancy about presenting himself to these ladies perhaps they didnt like americans he was always afraid of meeting french people who didnt it was the same way with most of the fellows in his battalion he had found they were terribly afraid of being disliked and the moment they felt they were disliked they hastened to behave as badly as possible in order to deserve it then they didnt feel that they had been taken inthe worst feeling a doughboy could possibly have claude thought he would stroll about to look at the town a little it had been taken by the germans in the autumn of 1914 after their retreat from the marne and they had held it until about a year ago when it was retaken by the english and the chasseurs dalpins they had been able to reduce it and to drive the germans out only by battering it down with artillery not one building remained standing ruin was ugly and it was nothing more claude was thinking as he followed the paths that ran over piles of brick and plaster there was nothing picturesque about this as there was in the war pictures one saw at home a cyclone or a fire might have done just as good a job the place was simply a great dumpheap an exaggeration of those which disgrace the outskirts of american towns it was the same thing over and over mounds of burned brick and broken stone heaps of rusty twisted iron splintered beams and rafters stagnant pools cellar holes full of muddy water an american soldier had stepped into one of those holes a few nights before and been drowned this had been a rich town of eighteen thousand inhabitants now the civilian population was about four hundred there were people there who had hung on all through the years of german occupation others who as soon as they heard that the enemy was driven out came back from wherever they had found shelter they were living in cellars or in little wooden barracks made from old timbers and american goods boxes as he walked along claude read familiar names and addresses painted on boards built into the sides of these frail shelters from emery bird thayer co kansas city mo daniels and fisher denver colo these inscriptions cheered him so much that he began to feel like going up and calling on the french ladies the sun had come out hot after three days of rain the stagnant pools and the weeds that grew in the ditches gave out a rank heavy smell wild flowers grew triumphantly over the piles of rotting wood and rusty iron cornflowers and queen annes lace and poppies blue and white and red as if the french colours came up spontaneously out of the french soil no matter what the germans did to it claude paused before a little shanty built against a halfdemolished brick wall a gilt cage hung in the doorway with a canary singing beautifully an old woman was working in the garden patch picking out bits of brick and plaster the rain had washed up digging with her fingers around the pale carrottops and neat lettuce heads claude approached her touched his helmet and asked her how one could find the way to the red cross she wiped her hands on her apron and took him by the elbow vous savez le tank anglais non marie marie he learned afterward that every one was directed to go this way or that from a disabled british tank that had been left on the site of the old town hall a little girl ran out of the barrack and her grandmother told her to go at once and take the american to the red cross marie put her hand in claudes and led him off along one of the paths that wound among the rubbish she took him out of the way to show him a churchevidently one of the ruins of which they were proudestwhere the blue sky was shining through the white arches the virgin stood with empty arms over the central door a little foot sticking to her robe showed where the infant jesus had been shot away le bébé est cassé mais il a protégé sa mère marie explained with satisfaction as they went on she told claude that she had a soldier among the americans who was her friend il est bon il est gai mon soldat but he sometimes drank too much alcohol and that was a bad habit perhaps now since his comrade had stepped into a cellar hole monday night while he was drunk and had been drowned her sharlie would be warned and would do better marie was evidently a well brought up child her father she said had been a schoolmaster at the foot of the convent hill she turned to go home claude called her back and awkwardly tried to give her some money but she thrust her hands behind her and said resolutely non merci je nai besoin de rien and then ran away down the path as he climbed toward the top of the hill he noticed that the ground had been cleaned up a bit the path was clear the bricks and hewn stones had been piled in neat heaps the broken hedges had been trimmed and the dead parts cut away emerging at last into the garden he stood still for wonder even though it was in ruins it seemed so beautiful after the disorder of the world below the gravel walks were clean and shining a wall of very old boxwoods stood green against a row of dead lombardy poplars along the shattered side of the main building a pear tree trained on wires like a vine still flourishedfull of little red pears around the stone well was a shaven grass plot and everywhere there were little trees and shrubs which had been too low for the shells to hitor for the fire which had seared the poplars to catch the hill must have been wrapped in flames at one time and all the tall trees had been burned the barrack was built against the walls of the cloisterthree arches of which remained like a stone wing to the shed of planks on a ladder stood a onearmed young man driving nails very skillfully with his single hand he seemed to be making a frame projection from the sloping roof to support an awning he carried his nails in his mouth when he wanted one he hung his hammer to the belt of his trousers took a nail from between his teeth stuck it into the wood and then deftly rapped it on the head claude watched him for a moment then went to the foot of the ladder and held out his two hands laissezmoi he exclaimed the one aloft spat his nails out into his palm looked down and laughed he was about claudes age with very yellow hair and moustache and blue eyes a charming looking fellow willingly he said this is no great affair but i do it to amuse myself and it will be pleasant for the ladies he descended and gave his hammer to the visitor claude set to work on the frame while the other went under the stone arches and brought back a roll of canvaspart of an old tent by the look of it un héritage des boches he explained unrolling it upon the grass i found it among their filth in the cellar and had the idea to make a pavilion for the ladies as our trees are destroyed he stood up suddenly perhaps you have come to see the ladies plus tard very well the boy said they would get the pavilion done for a surprise for mlle olive when she returned she was down in the town now visiting the sick people he bent over his canvas again measuring and cutting with a pair of garden shears moving round the green plot on his knees and all the time singing claude wished he could understand the words of his song while they were working together tying the cloth up to the frame claude from his elevation saw a tall girl coming slowly up the path by which he had ascended she paused at the top by the boxwood hedge as if she were very tired and stood looking at them presently she approached the ladder and said in slow careful english good morning louis has found help i see claude came down from his perch are you mlle de courcy i am claude wheeler i have a note of introduction to you if i can find it she took the card but did not look at it that is not necessary your uniform is enough why have you come he looked at her in some confusion well really i dont know i am just in from the front to see colonel james and he is in paris so i must wait over a day one of the staff suggested my coming up herei suppose because it is so nice he finished ingenuously then you are a guest from the front and you will have lunch with louis and me madame barre is also gone for the day will you see our house she led him through the low door into a living room unpainted uncarpeted light and airy there were coloured war posters on the clean board walls brass shell cases full of wild flowers and garden flowers canvas campchairs a shelf of books a table covered by a white silk shawl embroidered with big butterflies the sunlight on the floor the bunches of fresh flowers the white window curtains stirring in the breeze reminded claude of something but he could not remember what we have no guest room said mlle de courcy but you will come to mine and louis will bring you hot water to wash in a wooden chamber at the end of the passage claude took off his coat and set to work to make himself as tidy as possible hot water and scented soap were in themselves pleasant things the dresser was an old goods box stood on end and covered with white lawn on it there was a row of ivory toilet things with combs and brushes powder and cologne and a pile of white handkerchiefs fresh from the iron he felt that he ought not to look about him much but the odor of cleanness and the indefinable air of personality tempted him in one corner a curtain on a rod made a clothescloset in another was a low iron bed like a soldiers with a pale blue coverlid and white pillows he moved carefully and splashed discreetly there was nothing he could have damaged or broken not even a rug on the plank floor and the pitcher and handbasin were of iron yet he felt as if he were imperiling something fragile when he came out the table in the living room was set for three the stout old dame who was placing the plates paid no attention to himseemed from her expression to scorn him and all his kind he withdrew as far as possible out of her path and picked up a book from the table a volume of heines reisebilder in german before lunch mlle de courcy showed him the store room in the rear where the shelves were stocked with rows of coffee tins condensed milk canned vegetables and meat all with american trade names he knew so well names which seemed doubly familiar and reliable here so far from home she told him the people in the town could not have got through the winter without these things she had to deal them out sparingly where the need was greatest but they made the difference between life and death now that it was summer the people lived by their gardens but old women still came to beg for a few ounces of coffee and mothers to get a can of milk for the babies claudes face glowed with pleasure yes his country had a long arm people forgot that but here he felt was some one who did not forget when they sat down to lunch he learned that mlle de courcy and madame barre had been here almost a year now they came soon after the town was retaken when the old inhabitants began to drift back the people brought with them only what they could carry in their arms they must love their country so much dont you think when they endure such poverty to come back to it she said even the old ones do not often complain about their dear thingstheir linen and their china and their beds if they have the ground and hope all that they can make again this war has taught us all how little the made things matter only the feeling matters exactly so hadnt he been trying to say this ever since he was born hadnt he always known it and hadnt it made life both bitter and sweet for him what a beautiful voice she had this mlle olive and how nobly it dealt with the english tongue he would like to say something but out of so much what he remained silent therefore sat nervously breaking up the black war bread that lay beside his plate he saw her looking at his hand felt in a flash that she regarded it with favour and instantly put it on his knee under the table it is our trees that are worst she went on sadly you have seen our poor trees it makes one ashamed for this beautiful part of france our people are more sorry for them than to lose their cattle and horses mlle de courcy looked overtaxed by care and responsibility claude thought as he watched her she seemed far from strong slender greyeyed darkhaired with white transparent skin and a too ardent colour in her lips and cheekslike the flame of a feverish activity within her shoulders drooped as if she were always tired she must be young too though there were threads of grey in her hairbrushed flat and knotted carelessly at the back of her head after the coffee mlle de courcy went to work at her desk and louis took claude to show him the garden the clearing and trimming and planting were his own work and he had done it all with one arm this autumn he would accomplish much more for he was stronger now and he had the habitude of working singlehanded he must manage to get the dead trees down they distressed mademoiselle olive in front of the barrack stood four old locusts the tops were naked forks burned coalblack but the lower branches had put out thick tufts of yellowgreen foliage so vigorous that the life in the trunks must still be sound this fall louis said he meant to get some strong american boys to help him and they would saw off the dead limbs and trim the tops flat over the thick boles how much it must mean to a man to love his country like this claude thought to love its trees and flowers to nurse it when it was sick and tend its hurts with one arm among the flowers which had come back selfsown or from old roots claude found a group of tall straggly plants with reddish stems and tiny white blossomsone of the evening primrose family the gaura that grew along the clay banks of lovely creek at home he had never thought it very pretty but he was pleased to find it here he had supposed it was one of those nameless prairie flowers that grew on the prairie and nowhere else when they went back to the barrack mlle olive was sitting in one of the canvas chairs louis had placed under the new pavilion what a fine fellow he is claude exclaimed looking after him louis yes he was my brothers orderly when emile came home on leave he always brought louis with him and louis became like one of the family the shell that killed my brother tore off his arm my mother and i went to visit him in the hospital and he seemed ashamed to be alive poor boy when my brother was dead he put his hand over his face and began to cry and said oh madame il était toujours plus chic que moi although mlle olive spoke english well claude saw that she did so only by keeping her mind intently upon it the stiff sentences she uttered were foreign to her nature her face and eyes ran ahead of her tongue and made one wait eagerly for what was coming he sat down in a sagging canvas chair absently twisting a sprig of gaura he had pulled you have found a flower she looked up yes it grows at home on my fathers farm she dropped the faded shirt she was darning oh tell me about your country i have talked to so many but it is difficult to understand yes tell me about that nebraskawhat was it how many days from the sea what did it look like as he tried to describe it she listened with halfclosed eyes flatcovered with grainmuddy rivers i think it must be like russia but your fathers farm describe that to me minutely and perhaps i can see the rest claude took a stick and drew a square in the sand there to begin with was the house and farmyard there was the big pasture with lovely creek flowing through it there were the wheatfields and cornfields the timber claim more wheat and corn more pastures there it all was diagrammed on the yellow sand with shadows gliding over it from the halfcharred locust trees he would not have believed that he could tell a stranger about it in such detail it was partly due to his listener no doubt she gave him unusual sympathy and the glow of an unusual mind while she bent over his map questioning him a light dew of perspiration gathered on her upper lip and she breathed faster from her effort to see and understand everything he told her about his mother and his father and mahailey what life was like there in summer and winter and autumnwhat it had been like in that fateful summer when the hun was moving always toward paris and on those three days when the french were standing at the marne how his mother and father waited for him to bring the news at night and how the very cornfields seemed to hold their breath mlle olive sank back wearily in her chair claude looked up and saw tears sparkling in her brilliant eyes and i myself she murmured did not know of the marne until days afterward though my father and brother were both there i was far off in brittany and the trains did not run that is what is wonderful that you are here telling me this we we were taught from childhood that some day the germans would come we grew up under that threat but you were so safe with all your wheat and corn nothing could touch you nothing claude dropped his eyes yes he muttered blushing shame could it pretty nearly did we are pretty late he rose from his chair as if he were going to fetch something but where was he to get it from he shook his head i am afraid he said mournfully there is nothing i can say to make you understand how far away it all seemed how almost visionary it didnt only seem miles away it seemed centuries away but you do comeso many and from so far it is the last miracle of this war i was in paris on the fourth day of july when your marines just from belleau wood marched for your national fete and i said to myself as they came on that is a new man such heads they had so fine there behind the ears such discipline and purpose our people laughed and called to them and threw them flowers but they never turned to look eyes straight before they passed like men of destiny she threw out her hands with a swift movement and dropped them in her lap the emotion of that day came back in her face as claude looked at her burning cheeks her burning eyes he understood that the strain of this war had given her a perception that was almost like a gift of prophecy a woman came up the hill carrying a baby mlle de courcy went to meet her and took her into the house claude sat down again almost lost to himself in the feeling of being completely understood of being no longer a stranger in the far distance the big guns were booming at intervals down in the garden louis was singing again he wished he knew the words of louis songs the airs were rather melancholy but they were sung very cheerfully there was something open and warm about the boys voice as there was about his facesomething blond too it was distinctly a bland voice like summer wheatfields ripe and waving claude sat alone for half an hour or more tasting a new kind of happiness a new kind of sadness ruin and new birth the shudder of ugly things in the past the trembling image of beautiful ones on the horizon finding and losing that was life he saw when his hostess came back he moved her chair for her out of the creeping sunlight i didnt know there were any french girls like you he said simply as she sat down she smiled i do not think there are any french girls left there are children and women i was twentyone when the war came and i had never been anywhere without my mother or my brother or sister within a year i went all over france alone with soldiers with senegalese with anybody everything is different with us she lived at versailles she told him where her father had been an instructor in the military school he had died since the beginning of the war her grandfather was killed in the war of 1870 hers was a family of soldiers but not one of the men would be left to see the day of victory she looked so tired that claude knew he had no right to stay long shadows were falling in the garden it was hard to leave but an hour more or less wouldnt matter two people could hardly give each other more if they were together for years he thought will you tell me where i can come and see you if we both get through this war he asked as he rose he wrote it down in his notebook i shall look for you she said giving him her hand there was nothing to do but to take his helmet and go at the edge of the hill just before he plunged down the path he stopped and glanced back at the garden lying flattened in the sun the three stone arches the dahlias and marigolds the glistening boxwood wall he had left something on the hilltop which he would never find again the next afternoon claude and his sergeant set off for the front they had been told at headquarters that they could shorten their route by following the big road to the military cemetery and then turning to the left it was not advisable to go the latter half of the way before nightfall so they took their time through the belt of straggling crops and hayfields when they struck the road they came upon a big highlander sitting in the end of an empty supply wagon smoking a pipe and rubbing the dried mud out of his kilts the horses were munching in their nosebags and the driver had disappeared the americans hadnt happened to meet with any highlanders before and were curious this one must be a good fighter they thought a brawny giant with a bulldog jaw and a face as red and knobby as his knees more because he admired the looks of the man than because he needed information hicks went up and asked him if he had noticed a military cemetery on the road back the kilt nodded about how far back would you say it was i wouldnt say at all i take no account of their kilometers he replied dryly rubbing away at his skirt as if he had it in a washtub well about how long will it take us to walk it that i couldnt say a scotsman would do it in an hour i guess a yankee can do it as quick as a scotchman cant be hicks asked jovially that i couldnt say youve been four years gettin this far i know verra well hicks blinked as if he had been hit oh if thats the way you talk thats the way i do said the other sourly claude put out a warning hand come on hicks youll get nothing by it they went up the road very much disconcerted hicks kept thinking of things he might have said when he was angry the sergeants forehead puffed up and became dark red like a young babys what did you call me off for he sputtered i dont see where youd have come out in an argument and you certainly couldnt have licked him they turned aside at the cemetery to wait until the sun went down it was unfenced unsodded and a wagon trail ran through the middle bisecting the square on one side were the french graves with white crosses on the other side the german graves with black crosses poppies and cornflower ran over them the americans strolled about reading the names here and there the soldiers photograph was nailed upon his cross left by some comrade to perpetuate his memory a little longer the birds that always came to life at dusk and dawn began to sing flying home from somewhere claude and hicks sat down between the mounds and began to smoke while the sun dropped lines of dead trees marked the red west this was a dreary stretch of country even to boys brought up on the flat prairie they smoked in silence meditating and waiting for night on a cross at their feet the inscription read merely soldat inconnu mort pour la france a very good epitaph claude was thinking most of the boys who fell in this war were unknown even to themselves they were too young they died and took their secret with themwhat they were and what they might have been the name that stood was la france how much that name had come to mean to him since he first saw a shoulder of land bulk up in the dawn from the deck of the anchises it was a pleasant name to say over in ones mind where one could make it as passionately nasal as one pleased and never blush hicks too had been lost in his reflections now he broke the silence somehow lieutenant mort seems deader than dead it has a coffinish sound and over there theyre all tod and its all the same damned silly thing look at them set out here black and white like a checkerboard the next question is who put em here and whats the good of it search me the other murmured absently hicks rolled another cigarette and sat smoking it his plump face wrinkled with the gravity and labour of his cerebration well he brought out at last wed better hike this afterglow will hang on for an houralways does over here i suppose we had they rose to go the white crosses were now violet and the black ones had altogether melted in the shadow behind the dead trees in the west a long smear of red still burned to the north the guns were tuning up with a deep thunder somebodys getting peppered up there do owls always hoot in graveyards just what i was wondering lieutenant its a peaceful spot otherwise goodnight boys said hicks kindly as they left the graves behind them they were soon finding their way among shell holes and jumping trenchtops in the darkbeginning to feel cheerful at getting back to their chums and their own little group hicks broke out and told claude how he and dell able meant to go into business together when they got home were going to open a garage and automobilerepair shop under their talk in the minds of both that lonely spot lingered and the legend soldat inconnu mort pour la france xi after four days rest in the rear the battalion went to the front again in new country about ten kilometers east of the trench they had relieved before one morning colonel scott sent for claude and gerhardt and spread his maps out on the table we are going to clean them out there in f 6 tonight and straighten our line the thing that bothers us is that little village stuck up on the hill where the enemy machine guns have a strong position i want to get them out of there before the battalion goes over we cant spare too many men and i dont like to send out more officers than i can help it wont do to reduce the battalion for the major operation do you think you two boys could manage it with a hundred men the point is you will have to be out and back before our artillery begins at three oclock under the hill where the village stood ran a deep ravine and from this ravine a twisting water course wound up the hillside by climbing this gully the raiders should be able to fall on the machine gunners from the rear and surprise them but first they must get across the open stretch nearly one and a half kilometers wide between the american line and the ravine without attracting attention it was raining now and they could safely count on a dark night the night came on black enough the company crossed the open stretch without provoking fire and slipped into the ravine to wait for the hour of attack a young doctor a pennsylvanian lately attached to the staff had volunteered to come with them and he arranged a dressing station at the bottom of the ravine where the stretchers were left they were to pick up their wounded on the way back anything left in that area would be exposed to the artillery fire later on at ten oclock the men began to ascend the watercourse creeping through pools and little waterfalls making a continuous spludgy sound like pigs rubbing against the sty claude with the head of the column was just pulling out of the gully on the hillside above the village when a flare went up and a volley of fire broke from the brush on the uphill side of the watercourse machine guns opening on the exposed line crawling below the hun had been warned that the americans were crossing the plain and had anticipated their way of approach the men in the gully were trapped they could not retaliate with effect and the bullets from the maxims bounded on the rocks about them like hail gerhardt ran along the edge of the line urging the men not to fall back and double on themselves but to break out of the gully on the downhill side and scatter claude with his group started back go into the brush and get em our fellows have got no chance down there grenades while they last then bayonets pull your plugs and dont hold on too long they were already on the run charging the brush the hun gunners knew the hill like a book and when the bombs began bursting among them they took to trails and burrows dont follow them off into the rocks claude kept calling straight ahead clear everything to the ravine as the german gunners made for cover the firing into the gully stopped and the arrested column poured up the steep defile after gerhardt claude and his party found themselves back at the foot of the hill at the edge of the ravine from which they had started heavy firing on the hill above told them the rest of the men had got through the quickest way back to the scene of action was by the same watercourse they had climbed before they dropped into it and started up claude at the rear felt the ground rise under him and he was swept with a mountain of earth and rock down into the ravine he never knew whether he lost consciousness or not it seemed to him that he went on having continuous sensations the first was that of being blown to pieces of swelling to an enormous size under intolerable pressure and then bursting next he felt himself shrink and tingle like a frostbitten body thawing out then he swelled again and burst this was repeated he didnt know how often he soon realized that he was lying under a great weight of earth his body not his head he felt rain falling on his face his left hand was free and still attached to his arm he moved it cautiously to his face he seemed to be bleeding from the nose and ears now he began to wonder where he was hurt he felt as if he were full of shell splinters everything was buried but his head and left shoulder a voice was calling from somewhere below are any of you fellows alive claude closed his eyes against the rain beating in his face the same voice came again with a note of patient despair if theres anybody left alive in this hole wont he speak up im badly hurt myself that must be the new doctor wasnt his dressing station somewhere down here hurt he said claude tried to move his legs a little perhaps if he could get out from under the dirt he might hold together long enough to reach the doctor he began to wriggle and pull the wet earth sucked at him it was painful business he braced himself with his elbows but kept slipping back im the only one left then said the mournful voice below at last claude worked himself out of his burrow but he was unable to stand every time he tried to stand he got faint and seemed to burst again something was the matter with his right ankle toohe couldnt bear his weight on it perhaps he had been too near the shell to be hit he had heard the boys tell of such cases it had exploded under his feet and swept him down into the ravine but hadnt left any metal in his body if it had put anything into him it would have put so much that he wouldnt be sitting here speculating he began to crawl down the slope on all fours is that the doctor where are you here on a stretcher they shelled us who are you our fellows got up didnt they i guess most of them did what happened back here im afraid its my fault the voice said sadly i used my flash light and that must have given them the range they put three or four shells right on top of us the fellows that got hurt in the gully kept stringing back here and i couldnt do anything in the dark i had to have a light to do anything i just finished putting on a johnson splint when the first shell came i guess theyre all done for now how many were there fourteen i think some of them werent much hurt theyd all be alive if i hadnt come out with you who were they but you dont know our names yet do you you didnt see lieutenant gerhardt among them dont think so nor sergeant hicks the fat fellow dont think so where are you hurt abdominal i cant tell anything without a light i lost my flash light it never occurred to me that it could make trouble its one i use at home when the babies are sick the doctor murmured claude tried to strike a match with no success wait a minute wheres your helmet he took off his metal hat held it over the doctor and managed to strike a light underneath it the wounded man had already loosened his trousers and now he pulled up his bloody shirt his groin and abdomen were torn on the left side the wound and the stretcher on which he lay supported a mass of dark coagulated blood that looked like a great cows liver i guess ive got mine the doctor murmured as the match went out claude struck another oh that cant be our fellows will be back pretty soon and we can do something for you no use lieutenant do you suppose you could strip a coat off one of those poor fellows i feel the cold terribly in my intestines i had a bottle of french brandy but i suppose its buried claude stripped off his own coat which was warm on the inside and began feeling about in the mud for the brandy he wondered why the poor man wasnt screaming with pain the firing on the hill had ceased except for the occasional click of a maxim off in the rocks somewhere his watch said 1210 could anything have miscarried up there suddenly voices above a clatter of boots on the shale he began shouting to them coming coming he knew the voice gerhardt and his rifles ran down into the ravine with a bunch of prisoners claude called to them to be careful dont strike a light theyve been shelling down here all right are you wheeler where are the wounded there arent any but the doctor and me get us out of here quick im all right but i cant walk they put claude on a stretcher and sent him ahead four big germans carried him and they were prodded to a lope by hicks and dell able four of their own men took up the doctor and gerhardt walked beside him in spite of their care the motion started the blood again and tore away the clots that had formed over his wounds he began to vomit blood and to strangle the men put the stretcher down gerhardt lifted the doctors head its over he said presently better make the best time you can they picked up their load again them that are carrying him now wont jolt him said oscar the pious swede b company lost nineteen men in the raid two days later the company went off on a tenday leave claudes sprained ankle was twice its natural size but to avoid being sent to the hospital he had to march to the railhead sergeant hicks got him a giant shoe he found stuck on the barbed wire entanglement claude and gerhardt were going off on their leave together xii a rainy autumn night papa joubert sat reading his paper he heard a heavy pounding on his garden gate kicking off his slippers he put on the wooden sabots he kept for mud shuffled across the dripping garden and opened the door into the dark street two tall figures with rifles and kits confronted him in a moment he began embracing them calling to his wife nom de diable maman cest david david et claude tous les deux sorrylooking soldiers they appeared when they stood in the candlelight plastered with clay their metal hats shining like copper bowls their clothes dripping pools of water upon the flags of the kitchen floor mme joubert kissed their wet cheeks and monsieur now that he could see them embraced them again whence had they come and how had it fared with them up there very well as anybody could see what did they want firstsupper perhaps their room was always ready for them and the clothes they had left were in the big chest david explained that their shirts had not once been dry for four days and what they most desired was to be dry and to be clean old martha already in bed was routed out to heat water m joubert carried the big washtub upstairs tomorrow for conversation he said tonight for repose the boys followed him and began to peel off their wet uniforms leaving them in two sodden piles on the floor there was one bath for both and they threw up a coin to decide which should get into the warm water first m joubert seeing claudes fat ankle strapped up in adhesive bandages began to chuckle oh i see the boche made you dance up there when they were clad in clean pyjamas out of the chest papa joubert carried their shirts and socks down for martha to wash he returned with the big meat platter on which was an omelette made of twelve eggs and stuffed with bacon and fried potatoes mme joubert brought the threestory earthen coffeepot to the door and called bon appetit the host poured the coffee and cut up the loaf with his clasp knife he sat down to watch them eat how had they found things up there anyway the boches polite and agreeable as usual finally when there was not a crumb of anything left he poured for each a little glass of brandy pour cider la digestion and wished them goodnight he took the candle with him perfect bliss claude reflected as the chill of the sheets grew warm around his body and he sniffed in the pillow the old smell of lavender to be so warm so dry so clean so beloved the journey down reviewed from here seemed beautiful as soon as they had got out of the region of martyred trees they found the land of france turning gold all along the river valleys the poplars and cottonwoods had changed from green to yellowevenly coloured looking like candle flames in the mist and rain across the fields along the horizon they ran like torches passed from hand to hand and all the willows by the little streams had become silver the vineyards were green still thickly spotted with curly bloodred branches it all flashed back beside his pillow in the dark this beautiful land this beautiful people this beautiful omelette gold poplars bluegreen vineyards wet scarlet vine leaves rain dripping into the court fragrant darkness sleep stronger than all xiii the woodland path was deep in leaves claude and david were lying on the dry springy heather among the flint boulders gerhardt with his stetson over his eyes was presumably asleep they were having fine weather for their holiday the forest rose about this open glade like an amphitheatre in golden terraces of horse chestnut and beech the big nuts dropped velvety and brown as if they had been soaked in oil and disappeared in the dry leaves below little black yew trees that had not been visible in the green of summer stood out among the curly yellow brakes through the grey netting of the beech twigs stiff holly bushes glittered it was the wheeler way to dread false happiness to feel cowardly about being fooled since he had come back claude had more than once wondered whether he took too much for granted and felt more at home here than he had any right to feel the americans were prone he had observed to make themselves very much at home to mistake good manners for goodwill he had no right to doubt the affection of the jouberts however that was genuine and personalnot a smooth surface under which almost any shade of scorn might lie and laugh was not in short the treacherous french politeness by which one must not let oneself be taken in merely having seen the season change in a country gave one the sense of having been there for a long time and anyway he wasnt a tourist he was here on legitimate business claudes sprained ankle was still badly swollen madame joubert was sure he ought not to move about on it at all begged him to sit in the garden all day and nurse it but the surgeon at the front had told him that if he once stopped walking he would have to go to the hospital so with the help of his hosts best hollywood cane he limped out into the forest every day this afternoon he was tempted to go still farther madame joubert had told him about some caves at the other end of the wood underground chambers where the country people had gone to live in times of great misery long ago in the english wars the english wars he could not remember just how far back they werebut long enough to make one feel comfortable as for him perhaps he would never go home at all perhaps when this great affair was over he would buy a little farm and stay here for the rest of his life that was a project he liked to play with there was no chance for the kind of life he wanted at home where people were always buying and selling building and pulling down he had begun to believe that the americans were a people of shallow emotions that was the way gerhardt had put it once and if it was true there was no cure for it life was so short that it meant nothing at all unless it were continually reinforced by something that endured unless the shadows of individual existence came and went against a background that held together while he was absorbed in his day dream of farming in france his companion stirred and rolled over on his elbow you know we are to join the battalion at a theyll be living like kings there hicks will get so fat hell drop over on the march headquarters must have something particularly nasty in mind the infantry is always fed up before a slaughter but ive been thinking i have some old friends at a suppose we go on there a day early and get them to take us in its a fine old place and i ought to go to see them the son was a fellow student of mine at the conservatoire he was killed the second winter of the war i used to go up there for the holidays with him i would like to see his mother and sister again youve no objection claude did not answer at once he lay squinting off at the beech trees without moving you always avoid that subject with me dont you he said presently what subject oh anything to do with the conservatoire or your profession i havent any profession at present ill never go back to the violin you mean you couldnt make up for the time youll lose gerhardt settled his back against a rock and got out his pipe that would be difficult but other things would be harder ive lost much more than time couldnt you have got exemption one way or another i might have my friends wanted to take it up and make a test case of me but i couldnt stand for it i didnt feel i was a good enough violinist to admit that i wasnt a man i often wish i had been in paris that summer when the war broke out then i would have gone into the french army on the first impulse with the other students and it would have been better david paused and sat puffing at his pipe just then a soft movement stirred the brakes on the hillside a little barefoot girl stood there looking about she had heard voices but at first did not see the uniforms that blended with the yellow and brown of the wood then she saw the sun shining on two heads one square and amber in colourthe other reddish bronze long and narrow she took their friendliness for granted and came down the hill stopping now and again to pick up shiny horse chestnuts and pop them into a sack she was dragging david called to her and asked her whether the nuts were good to eat oh non she exclaimed her face expressing the liveliest terror pour les cochons these inexperienced americans might eat almost anything the boys laughed and gave her some pennies pour les cochons aussi she stole about the edge of the wood stirring among the leaves for nuts and watching the two soldiers gerhardt knocked out his pipe and began to fill it again i went home to see my mother in may of 1914 i wasnt here when the war broke out the conservatoire closed at once so i arranged a concert tour in the states that winter and did very well that was before all the little russians went over and the field wasnt so crowded i had a second season and that went well but i was getting more nervous all the time i was only half there he smoked thoughtfully sitting with folded arms as if he were going over a succession of events or states of feeling when my number was drawn i reported to see what i could do about getting out i took a look at the other fellows who were trying to squirm and chucked it ive never been sorry not long afterward my violin was smashed and my career seemed to go along with it claude asked him what he meant while i was at camp dix i had to play at one of the entertainments my violin a stradivarius was in a vault in new york i didnt need it for that concert any more than i need it at this minute yet i went to town and brought it out i was taking it up from the station in a military car and a drunken taxi driver ran into us i wasnt hurt but the violin lying across my knees was smashed into a thousand pieces i didnt know what it meant then but since ive seen so many beautiful old things smashed ive become a fatalist claude watched his brooding head against the grey flint rock you ought to have kept out of the whole thing any army man would say so davids head went back against the boulder and he threw one of the chestnuts lightly into the air oh one violinist more or less doesnt matter but who is ever going back to anything thats what i want to know claude felt guilty as if david must have guessed what apostasy had been going on in his own mind this afternoon you dont believe we are going to get out of this war what we went in for do you he asked suddenly absolutely not the other replied with cool indifference then i certainly dont see what youre here for because in 1917 i was twentyfour years old and able to bear arms the war was put up to our generation i dont know what for the sins of our fathers probably certainly not to make the world safe for democracy or any rhetoric of that sort when i was doing stretcher work i had to tell myself over and over that nothing would come of it but that it had to be sometimes though i think something must nothing we expect but something unforeseen he paused and shut his eyes you remember in the old mythology tales how when the sons of the gods were born the mothers always died in agony maybe its only semele im thinking of at any rate ive sometimes wondered whether the young men of our time had to die to bring a new idea into the world something olympian id like to know i think i shall know since ive been over here this time ive come to believe in immortality do you claude was confused by this quiet question i hardly know ive never been able to make up my mind oh dont bother about it if it comes to you it comes you dont have to go after it i arrived at it in quite the same way i used to get things in artknowing them and living on them before i understood them such ideas used to seem childish to me gerhardt sprang up now have i told you what you want to know about my case he looked down at claude with a curious glimmer of amusement and affection im going to stretch my legs its four oclock he disappeared among the red pine stems where the sunlight made a rosecolored lake as it used to do in the summer as it would do in all the years to come when they were not there to see it claude was thinking he pulled his hat over his eyes and went to sleep the little girl on the edge of the beech wood left her sack and stole quietly down the hill sitting in the heather and drawing her feet up under her she stayed still for a long time and regarded with curiosity the relaxed deep breathing body of the american soldier the next day was claudes twentyfifth birthday and in honour of that event papa joubert produced a bottle of old burgundy from his cellar one of a few dozens he had laid in for great occasions when he was a young man during that week of idleness at madame jouberts claude often thought that the period of happy youth about which his old friend mrs erlich used to talk and which he had never experienced was being made up to him now he was having his youth in france he knew that nothing like this would ever come again the fields and woods would never again be laced over with this hazy enchantment as he came up the village street in the purple evening the smell of woodsmoke from the chimneys went to his head like a narcotic opened the pores of his skin and sometimes made the tears come to his eyes life had after all turned out well for him and everything had a noble significance the nervous tension in which he had lived for years now seemed incredible to him absurd and childish when he thought of it at all he did not torture himself with recollections he was beginning over again one night he dreamed that he was at home out in the ploughed fields where he could see nothing but the furrowed brown earth stretching from horizon to horizon up and down it moved a boy with a plough and two horses at first he thought it was his brother ralph but on coming nearer he saw it was himselfand he was full of fear for this boy poor claude he would never never get away he was going to miss everything while he was struggling to speak to claude and warn him he awoke in the years when he went to school in lincoln he was always hunting for some one whom he could admire without reservations some one he could envy emulate wish to be now he believed that even then he must have had some faint image of a man like gerhardt in his mind it was only in war times that their paths would have been likely to cross or that they would have had anything to do together any of the common interests that make men friends xiv gerhardt and claude wheeler alighted from a taxi before the open gates of a squareroofed solidlooking house where all the shutters on the front were closed and the tops of many trees showed above the garden wall they crossed a paved court and rang at the door an old valet admitted the young men and took them through a wide hall to the salon which opened on the garden madame and mademoiselle would be down very soon david went to one of the long windows and looked out they have kept it up in spite of everything it was always lovely here the garden was spaciouslike a little park on one side was a tennis court on the other a fountain with a pool and waterlilies the north wall was hidden by ancient yews on the south two rows of plane trees cut square made a long arbour at the back of the garden there were fine old lindens the gravel walks wound about beds of gorgeous autumn flowers in the rose garden small white roses were still blooming though the leaves were already red two ladies entered the drawingroom the mother was short plump and rosy with strong rather masculine features and yellowish white hair the tears flashed into her eyes as david bent to kiss her hand and she embraced him and touched both his cheeks with her lips et vous vous aussi she murmured touching the coat of his uniform with her fingers there was but a moment of softness she gathered herself up like an old general claude thought as he stood watching the group from the window drew her daughter forward and asked david whether he recognized the little girl with whom he used to play mademoiselle claire was not at all like her mother slender dark dressed in a white costume de tennis and an apple green hat with black ribbons she looked very modern and casual and unconcerned she was already telling david she was glad he had arrived early as now they would be able to have a game of tennis before tea maman would bring her knitting to the garden and watch them this last suggestion relieved claudes apprehension that he might be left alone with his hostess when david called him and presented him to the ladies mlle claire gave him a quick handshake and said she would be very glad to try him out on the court as soon as she had beaten david they would find tennis shoes in their rooma collection of shoes for the feet of all nations her brothers some that his russian friend had forgotten when he hurried off to be mobilized and a pair lately left by an english officer who was quartered on them she and her mother would wait in the garden she rang for the old valet the americans found themselves in a large room upstairs where two modern iron beds stood out conspicuous among heavy mahogany bureaus and desks and dressingtables stuffed chairs and velvet carpets and dull red brocade window hangings david went at once into the little dressingroom and began to array himself for the tennis court two suits of flannels and a row of soft shirts hung there on the wall arent you going to change he asked noticing that claude stood stiff and unbending by the window looking down into the garden why should i said claude scornfully i dont play tennis i never had a racket in my hand too bad she used to play very well though she was only a youngster then gerhardt was regarding his legs in trousers two inches too short for him how everything has changed and yet how everything is still the same its like coming back to places in dreams they dont give you much time to dream i should say claude remarked fortunately explain to the girl that i dont play will you ill be down later as you like claude stood in the window watching gerhardts bare head and mlle claires green hat and long brown arm go bounding about over the court when gerhardt came to change before tea he found his fellow officer standing before his bag which was open but not unpacked whats the matter feeling shellshock again not exactly claude bit his lip the fact is dave i dont feel just comfortable here oh the people are all right but im out of place im going to pull out and get a billet somewhere else and let you visit your friends in peace why should i be here these people dont keep a hotel they very nearly do from what theyve been telling me theyve had a string of scotch and english quartered on them they like it tooor have the good manners to pretend they do of course youll do as you like but youll hurt their feelings and put me in an awkward position to be frank i dont see how you can go away without being distinctly rude claude stood looking down at the contents of his bag in an irresolute attitude catching a glimpse of his face in one of the big mirrors gerhardt saw that he looked perplexed and miserable his flash of temper died and he put his hand lightly on his friends shoulder come on claude this is too absurd you dont even have to dress thanks to your uniformand you dont have to talk since youre not supposed to know the language i thought youd like coming here these people have had an awfully rough time cant you admire their pluck oh yes i do its awkward for me though claude pulled off his coat and began to brush his hair vigorously i guess ive always been more afraid of the french than of the germans it takes courage to stay you understand i want to run but why what makes you want to oh i dont know something in the house in the atmosphere something disagreeable no something agreeable david laughed oh youll get over that they had tea in the garden english fashionenglish tea too mlle claire informed them left by the english officers at dinner a third member of the family was introduced a little boy with a cropped head and big black eyes he sat on claudes left quiet and shy in his velvet jacket though he followed the conversation eagerly especially when it touched upon his brother rene killed at verdun in the second winter of the war the mother and sister talked about him as if he were living about his letters and his plans and his friends at the conservatoire and in the army mlle claire told gerhardt news of all the girl students he had known in paris how this one was singing for the soldiers another when she was nursing in a hospital which was bombed in an air raid had carried twenty wounded men out of the burning building one after another on her back like sacks of flour alice the dancer had gone into the english red cross and learned english odette had married a new zealander an officer who was said to be a cannibal it was well known that his tribe had eaten two auvergnat missionaries there was a great deal more that claude could not understand but he got enough to see that for these women the war was france the war was life and everything that went into it to be alive to be conscious and have ones faculties was to be in the war after dinner when they went into the salon madame fleury asked david whether he would like to see renes violin again and nodded to the little boy he slipped away and returned carrying the case which he placed on the table he opened it carefully and took off the velvet cloth as if this was his peculiar office then handed the instrument to gerhardt david turned it over under the candles telling madame fleury that he would have known it anywhere renes wonderful amati almost too exquisite in tone for the concert hall like a woman who is too beautiful for the stage the family stood round and listened to his praise with evident satisfaction madame fleury told him that lucien was très sérieux with his music that his master was well pleased with him and when his hand was a little larger he would be allowed to play upon renes violin claude watched the little boy as he stood looking at the instrument in davids hands in each of his big black eyes a candle flame was reflected as if some steady fire were actually burning there what is it lucien his mother asked if monsieur david would be so good as to play before i must go to bed he murmured entreatingly but lucien i am a soldier now i have not worked at all for two years the amati would think it had fallen into the hands of a boche lucien smiled oh no it is too intelligent for that a little please and he sat down on a footstool before the sofa in confident anticipation mlle claire went to the piano david frowned and began to tune the violin madame fleury called the old servant and told him to light the sticks that lay in the fireplace she took the armchair at the right of the hearth and motioned claude to a seat on the left the little boy kept his stool at the other end of the room mlle claire began the orchestral introduction to the saintsaens concerto oh not that david lifted his chin and looked at her in perplexity she made no reply but played on her shoulders bent forward lucien drew his knees up under his chin and shivered when the time came the violin made its entrance david had put it back under his chin mechanically and the instrument broke into that suppressed bitter melody they played for a long while at last david stopped and wiped his forehead im afraid i cant do anything with the third movement really nor can i but that was the last thing rene played on it the night before he went away after his last leave she began again and david followed madame fleury sat with halfclosed eyes looking into the fire claude his lips compressed his hands on his knees was watching his friends back the music was a part of his own confused emotions he was torn between generous admiration and bitter bitter envy what would it mean to be able to do anything as well as that to have a hand capable of delicacy and precision and power if he had been taught to do anything at all he would not be sitting here tonight a wooden thing amongst living people he felt that a man might have been made of him but nobody had taken the trouble to do it tonguetied foottied handtied if one were born into this world like a bear cub or a bull calf one could only paw and upset things break and destroy all ones life gerhardt wrapped the violin up in its cloth the little boy thanked him and carried it away madame fleury and her daughter wished their guests goodnight david said he was warm and suggested going into the garden to smoke before they went to bed he opened one of the long windows and they stepped out on the terrace dry leaves were rustling down on the walks the yew trees made a solid wall blacker than the darkness the fountain must have caught the starlight it was the only shining thinga little clear column of twinkling silver the boys strolled in silence to the end of the walk i guess youll go back to your profession all right claude remarked in the unnatural tone in which people sometimes speak of things they know nothing about not i of course i had to play for them music has always been like a religion in this house listen he put up his hand far away the regular pulsation of the big guns sounded through the still night thats all that matters now it has killed everything else i dont believe it claude stopped for a moment by the edge of the fountain trying to collect his thoughts i dont believe it has killed anything it has only scattered things he glanced about hurriedly at the sleeping house the sleeping garden the clear starry sky not very far overhead its men like you that get the worst of it he broke out but as for me i never knew there was anything worth living for till this war came on before that the world seemed like a business proposition youll admit its a costly way of providing adventure for the young said david drily maybe so all the same claude pursued the argument to himself long after they were in their luxurious beds and david was asleep no battlefield or shattered country he had seen was as ugly as this world would be if men like his brother bayliss controlled it altogether until the war broke out he had supposed they did control it his boyhood had been clouded and enervated by that belief the prussians had believed it too apparently but the event had shown that there were a great many people left who cared about something else the intervals of the distant artillery fire grew shorter as if the big guns were tuning up choking to get something out claude sat up in his bed and listened the sound of the guns had from the first been pleasant to him had given him a feeling of confidence and safety tonight he knew why what they said was that men could still die for an idea and would burn all they had made to keep their dreams he knew the future of the world was safe the careful planners would never be able to put it into a straitjacketcunning and prudence would never have it to themselves why that little boy downstairs with the candlelight in his eyes when it came to the last cry as they said could carry on for ever ideals were not archaic things beautiful and impotent they were the real sources of power among men as long as that was true and now he knew it was truehe had come all this way to find outhe had no quarrel with destiny nor did he envy david he would give his own adventure for no mans on the edge of sleep it seemed to glimmer like the clear column of the fountain like the new moonalluring halfaverted the bright face of danger xv when claude and david rejoined their battalion on the 20th of september the end of the war looked as far away as ever the collapse of bulgaria was unknown to the american army and their acquaintance with european affairs was so slight that this would have meant very little to them had they heard of it the german army still held the north and east of france and no one could say how much vitality was left in that sprawling body the battalion entrained at arras lieutenant colonel scott had orders to proceed to the railhead and then advance on foot into the argonne the cars were crowded and the railway journey was long and fatiguing they detrained at night in the rain at what the men said seemed to be the jumping off place there was no town and the railway station had been bombed the day before by an air fleet out to explode artillery ammunition a mound of brick and holes full of water told where it had been the colonel sent claude out with a patrol to find some place for the men to sleep the patrol came upon a field of straw stacks and at the end of it found a black farmhouse claude went up and hammered on the door silence he kept hammering and calling the americans are here a shutter opened the farmer stuck his head out and demanded gruffly what was wanted what now claude explained in his best french that an american battalion had just come in might they sleep in his field if they did not destroy his stacks sure replied the farmer and shut the window that one word coming out of the dark in such an unpromising place had a cheering effect upon the patrol and upon the men when it was repeated to them sure eh they kept laughing over it as they beat about the field and dug into the straw those who couldnt burrow into a stack lay down in the muddy stubble they were asleep before they could feel sorry for themselves the farmer came out to offer his stable to the officers and to beg them not on any account to make a light they had never been bothered here by air raids until yesterday and it must be because the americans were coming and were sending in ammunition gerhardt who was called to talk to him told the farmer the colonel must study his map and for that the man took them down into the cellar where the children were asleep before he lay down on the straw bed his orderly had made for him the colonel kept telling names and kilometers off on his fingers for officers like colonel scott the names of places constituted one of the real hardships of the war his mind worked slowly but it was always on his job and he could go without sleep for more hours together than any of his officers tonight he had scarcely lain down when a sentinel brought in a runner with a message the colonel had to go into the cellar again to read it he was to meet colonel harvey at prince joachim farm as early as possible tomorrow morning the runner would act as guide the colonel sat with his eye on his watch and interrogated the messenger about the road and the time it would take to get over the ground whats fritzs temper up here generally speaking thats as it happens sir sometimes we nab a night patrol of a dozen or fifteen and send them to the rear under a oneman guard then again a little bunch of heinies will fight like the devil they say it depends on what part of germany they come from the bavarians and saxons are the bravest colonel scott waited for an hour and then went about shaking his sleeping officers yes sir captain maxey sprang to his feet as if he had been caught in a disgraceful act he called his sergeants and they began to beat the men up out of the strawstacks and puddles in half an hour they were on the road this was the battalions first march over really bad roads where walking was a question of pulling and balancing they were soon warm at any rate it kept them sweating the weight of their equipment was continually thrown in the wrong place their wet clothing dragged them back their packs got twisted and cut into their shoulders claude and hicks began wondering to each other what it must have been like in the real mud up about ypres and passchendaele two years ago hicks had been training at arras last week where a lot of tommies were resting in the same way and he had tales to tell the battalion got to joachim farm at nine oclock colonel harvey had not yet come up but old julius caesar was there with his engineers and he had a hot breakfast ready for them at six oclock in the evening they took the road again marching until daybreak with short rests during the night they captured two hun patrols a bunch of thirty men at the halt for breakfast the prisoners wanted to make themselves useful but the cook said they were so filthy the smell of them would make a stew go bad they were herded off by themselves a good distance from the grub line it was gerhardt of course who had to go over and question them claude felt sorry for the prisoners they were so willing to tell all they knew and so anxious to make themselves agreeable began talking about their relatives in america and said brightly that they themselves were going over at once after the warseemed to have no doubt that everybody would be glad to see them they begged gerhardt to be allowed to do something couldnt they carry the officers equipment on the march no they were too buggy they might relieve the sanitary squad oh that they would gladly do herr offizier the plan was to get to rupprecht trench and take it before nightfall it was easy takingempty of everything but vermin and human discards a dozen crippled and sick left for the enemy to dispose of and several halfwitted youths who ought to have been locked up in some institution fritz had known what it meant when his patrols did not come back he had evacuated leaving behind his hopelessly diseased and as much filth as possible the dugouts were fairly dry but so crawling with vermin that the americans preferred to sleep in the mud in the open after supper the men fell on their packs and began to lighten them throwing away all that was not necessary and much that was many of them abandoned the new overcoats that had been served out at the railhead others cut off the skirts and made the coats into ragged jackets captain maxey was horrified at these depredations but the colonel advised him to shut his eyes theyve got hard going before them let them travel light if theyd rather stand the cold theyve got a right to choose xvi the battalion had twentyfour hours rest at rupprecht trench and then pushed on for four days and nights stealing trenches capturing patrols with only a few hours sleepsnatched by the roadside while their food was being prepared they pushed hard after a retiring foe and almost outran themselves they did outrun their provisions on the fourth night when they fell upon a farm that had been a german headquarters the supplies that were to meet them there had not come up and they went to bed supperless this farmhouse for some reason called by the prisoners frau hulda farm was a nest of telephone wires hundreds of them ran out through the walls in all directions the colonel cut those he could find and then put a guard over the old peasant who had been left in charge of the house suspecting that he was in the pay of the enemy at last colonel scott got into the headquarters bed large and lumpythe first one he had seen since he left arras he had not been asleep more than two hours when a runner arrived with orders from the regimental colonel claude was in a bed in the loft between gerhardt and bruger he felt somebody shaking him but resolved that he wouldnt be disturbed and went on placidly sleeping then somebody pulled his hairso hard that he sat up captain maxey was standing over the bed come along boys orders from regimental headquarters the battalion is to split here our company is to go on four kilometers tonight and take the town of beaufort claude rose the men are pretty well beat out captain maxey and they had no supper that cant be helped tell them we are to be in beaufort for breakfast claude and gerhardt went out to the barn and roused hicks and his pal dell able the men were asleep in dry straw for the first time in ten days they were completely worn out lost to time and place many of them were already four thousand miles away scattered among little towns and farms on the prairie they were a miserable looking lot as they got together stumbling about in the dark after the colonel had gone over the map with captain maxey he came out and saw the company assembled he wasnt going with them he told them but he expected them to give a good account of themselves once in beaufort they would have a weeks rest sleep under cover and live among people for awhile the men took the road some with their eyes shut trying to make believe they were still asleep trying to have their agreeable dreams over again as they marched they did not really waken up until the advance challenged a hun patrol and sent it back to the colonel under a oneman guard when they had advanced two kilometers they found the bridge blown up claude and hicks went in one direction to look for a ford bruger and dell able in the other and the men lay down by the roadside and slept heavily just at dawn they reached the outskirts of the village silent and still captain maxey had no information as to how many germans might be left in the town they had occupied it ever since the beginning of the war and had used it as a rest camp there had never been any fighting there at the first house on the road the captain stopped and pounded no answer we are americans and must see the people of the house if you dont open we must break the door a womans voice called there is nobody here go away please and take your men away i am sick the captain called gerhardt who began to explain and reassure through the door it opened a little way and an old woman in a nightcap peeped out an old man hovered behind her she gazed in astonishment at the officers not understanding these were the first soldiers of the allies she had ever seen she had heard the germans talk about americans but thought it was one of their lies she said once convinced she let the officers come in and replied to their questions no there were no boches left in her house they had got orders to leave day before yesterday and had blown up the bridge they were concentrating somewhere to the east she didnt know how many were still in the village nor where they were but she could tell the captain where they had been triumphantly she brought out a map of the townlost she said with a meaning smile by a german officeron which the billets were marked with this to guide them captain maxey and his men went on up the street they took eight prisoners in one cellar seventeen in another when the villagers saw the prisoners bunched together in the square they came out of their houses and gave information this cleaning up bert fuller remarked was like taking fish from the platte river when the water was low simply pailing them out there was no sport in it at nine oclock the officers were standing together in the square before the church checking off on the map the houses that had been searched the men were drinking coffee and eating fresh bread from a bakers shop the square was full of people who had come out to see for themselves some believed that deliverance had come and others shook their heads and held back suspecting another trick a crowd of children were running about making friends with the soldiers one little girl with yellow curls and a clean white dress had attached herself to hicks and was eating chocolate out of his pocket gerhardt was bargaining with the baker for another baking of bread the sun was shining for a changeeverything was looking cheerful this village seemed to be swarming with girls some of them were pretty and all were friendly the men who had looked so haggard and forlorn when dawn overtook them at the edge of the town began squaring their shoulders and throwing out their chests they were dirty and mudplastered but as claude remarked to the captain they actually looked like fresh men suddenly a shot rang out above the chatter and an old woman in a white cap screamed and tumbled over on the pavementrolled about kicking indecorously with both hands and feet a second crackthe little girl who stood beside hicks eating chocolate threw out her hands ran a few steps and fell blood and brains oozing out in her yellow hair the people began screaming and running the americans looked this way and that ready to dash but not knowing where to go another shot and captain maxey fell on one knee blushed furiously and sprang up only to fall againashy white with the leg of his trousers going red there it is to the left hicks shouted pointing they saw now from a closed house some distance down a street off the square smoke was coming it hung before one of the upstairs windows the captains orderly dragged him into a wineshop claude and david followed by the men ran down the street and broke in the door the two officers went through the rooms on the first floor while hicks and his lot made straight for an enclosed stairway at the back of the house as they reached the foot of the stairs they were met by a volley of rifle shots and two of the men tumbled over four germans were stationed at the head of the steps the americans scarcely knew whether their bullets or their bayonets got to the huns first they were not conscious of going up till they were there when claude and david reached the landing the squad were wiping their bayonets and four grey bodies were piled in the corner bert fuller and dell able ran down the narrow hallway and threw open the door into the room on the street two shots and dell came back with his jaw shattered and the blood spouting from the left side of his neck gerhardt caught him and tried to close the artery with his fingers how many are in there bert claude called i couldnt see look out sir you cant get through that door more than two at a time the door still stood open at the end of the corridor claude went down the steps until he could sight along the floor of the passage into the front room the shutters were closed in there and the sunlight came through the slats in the middle of the floor between the door and the windows stood a tall chest of drawers with a mirror attached to the top in the narrow space between the bottom of this piece of furniture and the floor he could see a pair of boots it was possible there was but one man in the room shooting from behind his movable fortthough there might be others hidden in the corners theres only one fellow in there i guess hes shooting from behind a big dresser in the middle of the room come on one of you well have to go in and get him willy katz the austrian boy from the omaha packing house stepped up and stood beside him now willy well both go in at once you jump to the right and i to the leftand one of us will jab him he cant shoot both ways at once are you ready all rightnow claude thought he was taking the more dangerous position himself but the german probably reasoned that the important man would be on the right as the two americans dashed through the door he fired claude caught him in the back with his bayonet under the shoulder blade but willy katz had got the bullet in his brain through one of his blue eyes he fell and never stirred the german officer fired his revolver again as he went down shouting in english english with no foreign accent you swine go back to chicago then he began choking with blood sergeant hicks ran in and shot the dying man through the temples nobody stopped him the officer was a tall man covered with medals and orders must have been very handsome his linen and his hands were as white as if he were going to a ball on the dresser were the files and paste and buffers with which he had kept his nails so pink and smooth a ring with a ruby beautifully cut was on his little finger bert fuller screwed it off and offered it to claude he shook his head that english sentence had unnerved him bert held the ring out to hicks but the sergeant threw down his revolver and broke out think id touch anything of his that beautiful little girl and my buddyhes worse than dead dell is worse he turned his back on his comrades so that they wouldnt see him cry can i keep it myself sir bert asked claude nodded david had come in and was opening the shutters this officer claude was thinking was a very different sort of being from the poor prisoners they had been scooping up like tadpoles from the cellars one of the men picked up a gorgeous silk dressing gown from the bed another pointed to a dressingcase full of hammered silver gerhardt said it was russian silver this man must have come from the eastern front bert fuller and nifty jones were going through the officers pockets claude watched them and thought they did about right they didnt touch his medals but his gold cigarette case and the platinum watch still ticking on his wristhe wouldnt have further need for them around his neck hung by a delicate chain was a miniature case and in it was a paintingnot as bert romantically hoped when he opened it of a beautiful woman but of a young man pale as snow with blurred forgetmenot eyes claude studied it wondering it looks like a poet or something probably a kid brother killed at the beginning of the war gerhardt took it and glanced at it with a disdainful expression probably there let him keep it bert he touched claude on the shoulder to call his attention to the inlay work on the handle of the officers revolver claude noticed that david looked at him as if he were very much pleased with himlooked indeed as if something pleasant had happened in this room where god knew nothing had where when they turned round a swarm of black flies was quivering with greed and delight over the smears willy katz body had left on the floor claude had often observed that when david had an interesting idea or a strong twinge of recollection it made him for the moment rather heartless just now he felt that gerhardts flash of high spirits was in some way connected with him was it because he had gone in with willy had david doubted his nerve xvii when the survivors of company b are old men and are telling over their good days they will say to each other oh that week we spent at beaufort they will close their eyes and see a little village on a low ridge lost in the forest overgrown with oak and chestnut and black walnut buried in autumn colour the streets drifted deep in autumn leaves great branches interlacing over the roofs of the houses wells of cool water that tastes of moss and tree roots up and down those streets they will see figures passing themselves young and brown and cleanlimbed and comrades long dead but still alive in that faraway village how they will wish they could tramp again nights on days in the mud and rain to drag sore feet into their old billets at beaufort to sink into those wide feather beds and sleep the round of the clock while the old women washed and dried their clothes for them to eat rabbit stew and pommes frites in the gardenrabbit stew made with red wine and chestnuts oh the days that are no more as soon as captain maxey and the wounded men had been started on their long journey to the rear carried by the prisoners the whole company turned in and slept for twelve hoursall but sergeant hicks who sat in the house off the square beside the body of his chum the next day the americans came to life as if they were new men just created in a new world and the people of the town came to life excitement change something to look forward to at last a new flag le drapeau étoilé floated along with the tricolour in the square at sunset the soldiers stood in formation behind it and sang the star spangled banner with uncovered heads the old people watched them from the doorways the americans were the first to bring madelon to beaufort the fact that the village had never heard this song that the children stood round begging for it chantezvous la madelon made the soldiers realize how far and how long out of the world these villagers had been the german occupation was like a deafness which nothing pierced but their own arrogant martial airs before claude was out of bed after his first long sleep a runner arrived from colonel scott notifying him that he was in charge of the company until further orders the german prisoners had buried their own dead and dug graves for the americans before they were sent off to the rear claude and david were billeted at the edge of the town with the woman who had given captain maxey his first information when they marched in yesterday morning their hostess told them at their midday breakfast that the old dame who was shot in the square and the little girl were to be buried this afternoon claude decided that the americans might as well have their funeral at the same time he thought he would ask the priest to say a prayer at the graves and he and david set off through the brilliant rustling autumn sunshine to find the cures house it was next the church with a highwalled garden behind it over the bellpull in the outer wall was a card on which was written tirez fort the priest himself came out to them an old man who seemed weak like his doorbell he stood in his black cap holding his hands against his breast to keep them from shaking and looked very old indeedbroken hopeless as if he were sick of this world and done with it nowhere in france had claude seen a face so sad as his yes he would say a prayer it was better to have christian burial and they were far from home poor fellows david asked him whether the german rule had been very oppressive but the old man did not answer clearly and his hands began to shake so uncontrollably over his cassock that they went away to spare him embarrassment he seems a little gone in the head dont you think claude remarked i suppose the war has used him up how can he celebrate mass when his hands quiver so as they crossed the church steps david touched claudes arm and pointed into the square look every doughboy has a girl already some of them have trotted out fatigue caps i supposed theyd thrown them all away those who had no caps stood with their helmets under their arms in attitudes of exaggerated gallantry talking to the womenwho seemed all to have errands abroad some of them let the boys carry their baskets one soldier was giving a delighted little girl a ride on his back after the funeral every man in the company found some sympathetic woman to talk to about his fallen comrades all the garden flowers and bead wreaths in beaufort had been carried out and put on the american graves when the squad fired over them and the bugle sounded the girls and their mothers wept poor willy katz for instance could never have had such a funeral in south omaha the next night the soldiers began teaching the girls to dance the pas seul and the fausse trot they had found an old violin in the town and oscar the swede scraped away on it they danced every evening claude saw that a good deal was going on and he lectured his men at parade but he realized that he might as well scold at the sparrows here was a village with several hundred women and only the grandmothers had husbands all the men were in the army hadnt even been home on leave since the germans first took the place the girls had been shut up for four years with young men who incessantly coveted them and whom they must constantly outwit the situation had been intolerableand prolonged the americans found themselves in the position of adam in the garden did you know sir said bert fuller breathlessly as he overtook claude in the street after parade that these lovely girls had to go out in the fields and work raising things for those dirty pigs to eat yes sir had to work in the fields under german sentinels marched out in the morning and back at night like convicts its sure up to us to give them a good time now one couldnt walk out of an evening without meeting loitering couples in the dusky streets and lanes the boys had lost all their bashfulness about trying to speak french they declared they could get along in france with three verbs and all happily in the first conjugation manger aimer payerquite enough they called beaufort our town and they were called our americans they were going to come back after the war and marry the girls and put in waterworks chezmoi sir bill gates called to claude saluting with a bloody hand as he stood skinning rabbits before the door of his billet bunny casualties are heavy in town this week you know wheeler david remarked one morning as they were shaving i think maxey would come back here on one leg if he knew about these excursions into the forest after mushrooms maybe arent you going to put a stop to them not i claude jerked setting the corners of his mouth grimly if the girls or their people make complaint to me ill interfere not otherwise ive thought the matter over oh the girls david laughed softly well its something to acquire a taste for mushrooms they dont get them at home do they when after eight days the americans had orders to march there was mourning in every house on their last night in town the officers received pressing invitations to the dance in the square claude went for a few moments and looked on david was dancing every dance but hicks was nowhere to be seen the poor fellow had been out of everything claude went over to the church to see whether he might be moping in the graveyard there as he walked about claude stopped to look at a grave that stood off by itself under a privet hedge with withered leaves and a little french flag on it the old woman with whom they stayed had told them the story of this grave the cures niece was buried there she was the prettiest girl in beaufort it seemed and she had a love affair with a german officer and disgraced the town he was a young bavarian quartered with this same old woman who told them the story and she said he was a nice boy handsome and gentle and used to sit up half the night in the garden with his head in his handshomesick lovesick he was always after this marie louise never pressed her but was always there grew up out of the ground under her feet the old woman said the girl hated germans like all the rest and flouted him he was sent to the front then he came back sick and almost deaf after one of the slaughters at verdun and stayed a long while that spring a story got about that some woman met him at night in the german graveyard the germans had taken the land behind the church for their cemetery and it joined the wall of the cures garden when the women went out into the fields to plant the crops marie louise used to slip away from the others and meet her bavarian in the forest the girls were sure of it now and they treated her with disdain but nobody was brave enough to say anything to the cure one day when she was with her bavarian in the wood she snatched up his revolver from the ground and shot herself she was a frenchwoman at heart their hostess said and the bavarian claude asked david later the story had become so complicated he could not follow it he justified her and promptly he took the same pistol and shot himself through the temples his orderly stationed at the edge of the thicket to keep watch heard the first shot and ran toward them he saw the officer take up the smoking pistol and turn it on himself but the kommandant couldnt believe that one of his officers had so much feeling he held an enquête dragged the girls mother and uncle into court and tried to establish that they were in conspiracy with her to seduce and murder a german officer the orderly was made to tell the whole story how and where they began to meet though he wasnt very delicate about the details he divulged he stuck to his statement that he saw lieutenant muller shoot himself with his own hand and the kommandant failed to prove his case the old cure had known nothing of all this until he heard it aired in the military court marie louise had lived in his house since she was a child and was like his daughter he had a stroke or something and has been like this ever since the girls friends forgave her and when she was buried off alone by the hedge they began to take flowers to her grave the kommandant put up an affiche on the hedge forbidding any one to decorate the grave apparently nothing during the german occupation stirred up more feeling than poor marie louise it would stir anybody claude reflected there was her lonely little grave the shadow of the privet hedge falling across it there at the foot of the cures garden was the german cemetery with heavy cement crossessome of them with long inscriptions lines from their poets and couplets from old hymns lieutenant muller was there somewhere probably strange how their story stood out in a world of suffering that was a kind of misery he hadnt happened to think of before but the same thing must have occurred again and again in the occupied territory he would never forget the cures hands his dim suffering eyes claude recognized david crossing the pavement in front of the church and went back to meet him hello i mistook you for hicks at first i thought he might be out here david sat down on the steps and lit a cigarette so did i i came out to look for him oh i expect hes found some shoulder to cry on do you realize claude you and i are the only men in the company who havent got engaged some of the married men have got engaged twice its a good thing were pulling out or wed have banns and a bunch of christenings to look after all the same murmured claude i like the women of this country as far as ive seen them while they sat smoking in silence his mind went back to the quiet scene he had watched on the steps of that other church on his first night in france the country girl in the moonlight bending over her sick soldier when they walked back across the square over the crackling leaves the dance was breaking up oscar was playing home sweet home for the last waltz le dernier baiser said david well tomorrow well be gone and the chances are we wont come back this way xviii with us its always a feast or a famine the men groaned when they sat down by the road to munch dry biscuit at noon they had covered eighteen miles that morning and had still seven more to go they were ordered to do the twentyfive miles in eight hours nobody had fallen out yet but some of the boys looked pretty well wilted nifty jones said he was done for sergeant hicks was expostulating with the fainthearted he knew that if one man fell out a dozen would if i can do it you can its worse on a fat man like me this is no march to make a fuss about why at arras i talked with a little tommy from one of those pal battalions that got slaughtered on the somme his battalion marched twentyfive miles in six hours in the heat of july into certain death they were all kids out of school not a man of them over fivefootthree called them the bantams youve got to hand it to them fellows ill hand anything to anybody but i cant go no farther on these jones muttered nursing his sore feet oh you were going to heave you onto the only horse in the company the officers they can walk when they got into battalion lines there was food ready for them but very few wanted it they drank and lay down in the bushes claude went at once to headquarters and found barclay owens of the engineers with the colonel who was smoking and studying his maps as usual glad to see you wheeler your men ought to be in good shape after a weeks rest let them sleep now weve got to move out of here before midnight to relieve two texas battalions at moltke trench theyve taken the trench with heavy casualties and are beat out couldnt hold it in case of counterattack as its an important point the enemy will try to recover it i want to get into position before daylight so he wont know fresh troops are coming in as ranking officer you are in charge of the company very well sir ill do my best im sure you will two machine gun teams are going up with us and some time tomorrow a missouri battalion comes up to support id have had you over here before but i only got my orders to relieve yesterday we may have to advance under shell fire the enemy has been putting a lot of big stuff over he wants to cut off that trench claude and david got into a fresh shell hole under the halfburned scrub and fell asleep they were awakened at dusk by heavy artillery fire from the north at ten oclock the battalion after a hot meal began to advance through almost impassable country the guns must have been pounding away at the same range for a long while the ground was worked and kneaded until it was soft as dough though no rain had fallen for a week barclay owens and his engineers were throwing down a plank road to get food and the ammunition wagons across big shells were coming over at intervals of twelve minutes the intervals were so regular that it was quite possible to get forward without damage while b company was pulling through the shell area colonel scott overtook them on foot his orderly leading his horse know anything about that light over there wheeler he asked well it oughtnt to be there come along and see the light was a mere matchhead down in the ground claude hadnt noticed it before he followed the colonel and when they reached the spark they found three officers of a company crouching in a shell crater covered with a piece of sheetiron put out that light called the colonel sharply whats the matter captain brace a young man rose quickly im waiting for the water sir its coming up on mules in petrol cases and i dont want to get separated from it the grounds so bad here the drivers are likely to get lost dont wait more than twenty minutes you must get up and take your position on time thats the important thing water or no water as the colonel and claude hurried back to overtake the company five big shells screamed over them in rapid succession run sir the orderly called theyre getting on to us theyve shortened the range that light back there was just enough to give them an idea the colonel muttered the bad ground continued for about a mile and then the advance reached headquarters behind the eighth trench of the great system of trenches it was an old farmhouse which the germans had made over with reinforced concrete lining it within and without until the walls were six feet thick and almost shellproof like a pillbox the colonel sent his orderly to enquire about a company a young lieutenant came to the door of the farmhouse a company is ready to go into position sir i brought them up where is captain brace lieutenant he and both our first lieutenants were killed colonel back in that hole a shell fell on them not five minutes after you were talking to them thats bad any other damage yes sir there was a cook wagon struck at the same time the first one coming along julius caesars new road the driver was killed and we had to shoot the horses captain owens he near got scalded with the stew the colonel called in the officers one after another and discussed their positions with them wheeler he said when claudes turn came you know your map youve noticed that sharp loop in the front trench in h 2 the boars head i believe they call it its a sort of spear point that reaches out toward the enemy and it will be a hot place to hold if i put your company in there do you think you can do the battalion credit in case of a counter attack claude said he thought so its the nastiest bit of the line to hold and you can tell your men i pay them a compliment when i put them there all right sir theyll appreciate it the colonel bit off the end of a fresh cigar theyd better by thunder if they give way and let the hun bombers in it will let down the whole line ill give you two teams of georgia machine guns to put in that point they call the boars snout when the missourians come up tomorrow theyll go in to support you but until then youll have to take care of the loop yourselves ive got an awful lot of trench to hold and i cant spare you any more men the texas men whom the battalion came up to relieve had been living for sixty hours on their iron rations and on what they could pick off the dead huns their supplies had been shelled on the way and nothing had got through to them when the colonel took claude and gerhardt forward to inspect the loop that b company was to hold they found a wallow more like a dump heap than a trench the men who had taken the position were almost too weak to stand all their officers had been killed and a sergeant was in command he apologized for the condition of the loop sorry to leave such a mess for you to clean up sir but we got it bad in here hes been shelling us every night since we drove him out i couldnt ask the men to do anything but hold on thats all right you beat it with your boys quick my men will hand you out some grub as you go back the battered defenders of the boars head stumbled past them through the darkness into the communication when the last man had filed out the colonel sent for barclay owens claude and david tried to feel their way about and get some idea of the condition the place was in the stench was the worst they had yet encountered but it was less disgusting than the flies when they inadvertently touched a dead body clouds of wet buzzing flies flew up into their faces into their eyes and nostrils under their feet the earth worked and moved as if boa constrictors were wriggling down there soft bodies lightly covered when they had found their way up to the snout they came upon a pile of corpses a dozen or more thrown one on top of another like sacks of flour faintly discernible in the darkness while the two officers stood there rumbling squirting sounds began to come from this heap first from one body then from anothergases swelling in the liquefying entrails of the dead men they seemed to be complaining to one another glup glup glup the boys went back to the colonel who was standing at the mouth of the communication and told him there was nothing much to report except that the burying squad was needed badly i expect the colonel shook his head when barclay owens arrived he asked him what could be done here before daybreak the doughty engineer felt his way about as claude and gerhardt had done they heard him coughing and beating off the flies but when he came back he seemed rather cheered than discouraged give me a gang to get the casualties out and with plenty of quicklime and concrete i can make this loop all right in four hours sir he declared ive brought plenty of lime but wherell you get your concrete the hun left about fifty sacks of it in the cellar under your headquarters i can do better of course if i have a few hours more for my concrete to dry go ahead captain the colonel told claude and david to bring their men up to the communication before light and hold them ready give owens cement a chance but dont let the enemy put over any surprise on you the shelling began again at daybreak it was hardest on the rear trenches and the threemile area behind evidently the enemy felt sure of what he had in moltke trench he wanted to cut off supplies and possible reinforcements the missouri battalion did not come up that day but before noon a runner arrived from their colonel with information that they were hiding in the wood five boche planes had been circling over the wood since dawn signalling to the enemy headquarters back on dauphin ridge the missourians were sure they had avoided detection by lying close in the underbrush they would come up in the night their linemen were following the runner and colonel scott would be in telephone communication with them in half an hour when b company moved into the boars head at one oclock in the afternoon they could truthfully say that the prevailing smell was now that of quicklime the parapet was evenly built up the firing step had been partly restored and in the snout there were good emplacements for the machine guns certain unpleasant reminders were still to be found if one looked for them in the snout a large fat boot stuck stiffly from the side of the trench captain ovens explained that the ground sounded hollow in there and the boot probably led back into a dugout where a lot of hun bodies were entombed together as he was pressed for time he had thought best not to look for trouble in one of the curves of the loop just at the top of the earth wall under the sand bags a dark hand reached out the five fingers well apart looked like the swollen roots of some noxious weed hicks declared that this object was disgusting and during the afternoon he made nifty jones and oscar scrape down some earth and make a hump over the paw but there was shelling in the night and the earth fell away look said jones when he wakened his sergeant the first thing i seen when daylight come was his old fingers wigglin in the breeze he wants air heinie does he wont stay covered hicks got up and reburied the hand himself but when he came around with claude on inspection before breakfast there were the same five fingers sticking out again the sergeants forehead puffed up and got red and he swore that if he found the man who played dirty jokes hed make him eat this one the colonel sent for claude and gerhardt to come to breakfast with him he had been talking by telephone with the missouri officers and had agreed that they should stay back in the bush for the present the continual circling of planes over the wood seemed to indicate that the enemy was concerned about the actual strength of moltke trench it was possible their air scouts had seen the texas men going backotherwise why were they holding off while the colonel and the officers were at breakfast a corporal brought in two pigeons he had shot at dawn one of them carried a message under its wing the colonel unrolled a strip of paper and handed it to gerhardt yes sir its in german but its code stuff its a german nursery rhyme those reconnoitering planes must have dropped scouts on our rear and they are sending in reports of course they can get more on us than the air men can here do you want these birds dick the boy grinned you bet i do sir i may get a chance to fry em later on after breakfast the colonel went to inspect b company in the boars head he was especially pleased with the advantageous placing of the machine guns in the snout i expect youll have a quiet day he said to the men but i wouldnt like to promise you a quiet night youll have to be very steady in here if fritz takes this loop hes got us you understand they had indeed a quiet day some of the men played cards and oscar read his bible the night too began well but at four fifteen everybody was roused by the gas alarm gas shells came over for exactly half an hour then the shrapnel broke loose not the long whizzing scream of solitary shells but drumfire continuous and deafening a hundred electrical storms seemed raging at once in the air and on the ground balls of fire were rolling all over the place the range was a little long for the boars head they were not getting the worst of it but thirty yards back everything was torn to pieces claude didnt see how anybody could be left alive back there a single twister had killed six of his men at the rear of the loop where they were shovelling to keep the communication clear captain owns neat earthworks were being badly pounded claude and gerhardt were consulting together when the smoke and darkness began to take on the livid colour that announced the coming of daybreak a messenger ran in from the colonel the missourians had not yet come up and his telephone communication with them was cut off he was afraid they had got lost in the bombardment the colonel says you are to send two men back to bring them up two men who can take charge if theyre stampeded when the messenger shouted this order gerhardt and hicks looked at each other quickly and volunteered to go claude hesitated hicks and david waited for no further consent they ran down the communication and disappeared claude stood in the smoke that was slowly growing greyer and looked after them with the deepest stab of despair he had ever known only a man who was bewildered and unfit to be in command of other men would have let his best friend and his best officer take such a risk he was standing there under shelter and his two friends were going back through that curtain of flying steel toward the square from which the lost battalion had last reported if he knew them they would not lose time following the maze of trenches they were probably even now out on the open running straight through the enemy barrage vaulting trench tops claude turned and went back into the loop well whatever happened he had worked with brave men it was worth having lived in this world to have known such men soldiers when they were in a tight place often made secret propositions to god and now he found himself offering terms if they would see to it that david came back they could take the price out of him he would pay did they understand an hour dragged by hard on the nerves waiting up the communication came a train with ammunition and coffee for the loop the men thought headquarters did pretty well to get hot food to them through that barrage a message came up in the colonels hand be ready when the barrage stops claude took this up and showed it to the machine gunners in the snout turning back he ran into hicks stripped to his shirt and trousers as wet as if he had come out of the river and splashed with blood his hand was wrapped up in a rag he put his mouth to claudes ear and shouted we found them they were lost theyre coming send word to the colonel wheres gerhardt hes coming bringing them up god its stopped the bombardment ceased with a suddenness that was stupefying the men in the loop gasped and crouched as if they were falling from a height the air rolling black with smoke and stifling with the smell of gases and burning powder was still as death the silence was like a heavy anaesthetic claude ran back to the snout to see that the gun teams were ready wake up boys you know why were here bert fuller who was up in the lookout dropped back into the trench beside him theyre coming sir claude gave the signal to the machine guns fire opened all along the loop in a moment a breeze sprang up and the heavy smoke clouds drifted to the rear mounting to the firestep he peered over the enemy was coming on eight deep on the left of the boars head in long waving lines that reached out toward the main trench suddenly the advance was checked the files of running men dropped behind a wrinkle in the earth fifty yards forward and did not instantly reappear it struck claude that they were waiting for something he ought to be clever enough to know for what but he was not the colonels line man came up to him headquarters has a runner from the missourians theyll be up in twenty minutes the colonel will put them in here at once till then you must manage to hold well hold fritz is behaving queerly i dont understand his tactics while he was speaking everything was explained the boars snout spread apart with an explosion that split the earth and went up in a volcano of smoke and flame claude and the colonels messenger were thrown on their faces when they got to their feet the snout was a smoking crater full of dead and dying men the georgia gun teams were gone it was for this that the hun advance had been waiting behind the ridge the mine under the snout had been made long ago probably on a venture when the hun held moltke trench for months without molestation during the last twentyfour hours they had been getting their explosives in reasoning that the strongest garrison would be placed there here they were coming on the run it was up to the rifles the men who had been knocked down by the shock were all on their feet again they looked at their officer questioningly as if the whole situation had changed claude felt they were going soft under his eyes in a moment the hun bombers would be in on them and they would break he ran along the trench pointing over the sand bags and shouting its up to you its up to you the rifles recovered themselves and began firing but claude felt they were spongy and uncertain that their minds were already on the way to the rear if they did anything it must be quick and their gunwork must be accurate nothing but a withering fire could check he sprang to the firestep and then out on the parapet something instantaneous happened he had his men in hand steady steady he called the range to the rifle teams behind him and he could see the fire take effect all along the hun lines men were stumbling and falling they swerved a little to the left he called the rifles to follow directing them with his voice and with his hands it was not only that from here he could correct the range and direct the fire the men behind him had become like rock that line of faces below hicks jones fuller anderson oscar their eyes never left him with these men he could do anything the right of the hun line swerved out not more than twenty yards from the battered snout trying to run to shelter under that pile of debris and human bodies a quick concentration of rifle fire depressed it and the swell came out again toward the left claudes appearance on the parapet had attracted no attention from the enemy at first but now the bullets began popping about him two rattled on his tin hat one caught him in the shoulder the blood dripped down his coat but he felt no weakness he felt only one thing that he commanded wonderful men when david came up with the supports he might find them dead but he would find them all there they were there to stay until they were carried out to be buried they were mortal but they were unconquerable the colonels twenty minutes must be almost up he thought he couldnt take his eyes from the front line long enough to look at his wrist watch the men behind him saw claude sway as if he had lost his balance and were trying to recover it then he plunged face down outside the parapet hicks caught his foot and pulled him back at the same moment the missourians ran yelling up the communication they threw their machine guns up on the sand bags and went into action without an unnecessary motion hicks and bert fuller and oscar carried claude forward toward the snout out of the way of the supports that were pouring in he was not bleeding very much he smiled at them as if he were going to speak but there was a weak blankness in his eyes bert tore his shirt open three clean bullet holes by the time they looked at him again the smile had gone the look that was claude had faded hicks wiped the sweat and smoke from his officers face thank god i never told him he said thank god for that bert and oscar knew what hicks meant gerhardt had been blown to pieces at his side when they dashed back through the enemy barrage to find the missourians they were running together across the open not able to see much for smoke they bumped into a section of wire entanglement left above an old trench david cut round to the right waving hicks to follow him the two were not ten yards apart when the shell struck then sergeant hicks ran on alone xix the sun is sinking low a transport is steaming slowly up the narrows with the tide the decks are covered with brown men they cluster over the superstructure like bees in swarming time their attitudes are relaxed and lounging some look thoughtful some well contented some are melancholy and many are indifferent as they watch the shore approaching they are not the same men who went away sergeant hicks was standing in the stern smoking reflecting watching the twinkle of the red sunset upon the cloudy water it is more than a year since he sailed for france the world has changed in that time and so has he bert fuller elbowed his way up to the sergeant the doctor says colonel maxey is dying he wont live to get off the boat much less to ride in the parade in new york tomorrow hicks shrugged as if maxeys pneumonia were no affair of his well we should worry weve left better officers than him over there im not saying we havent but it seems too bad when hes so strong for fuss and feathers hes been sending cables about that parade for weeks huh hicks elevated his eyebrows and glanced sidewise in disdain presently he sputtered squinting down at the glittering water colonel maxey anyhow colonel for what claude and gerhardt did i guess hicks and bert fuller have been helping to keep the noble fortress of ehrenbreitstein they have always hung together and are usually quarrelling and grumbling at each other when they are off duty still they hang together they are the last of their group nifty jones and oscar god only knows why have gone on to the black sea during the year they were in the rhine valley bert and hicks were separated only once and that was when hicks got a two weeks leave and by dint of persevering and fatiguing travel went to venice he had no proper passport and the consuls and officials to whom he had appealed in his difficulties begged him to content himself with something nearer but he said he was going to venice because he had always heard about it bert fuller was glad to welcome him back to coblentz and gave a wine party to celebrate his return they expect to keep an eye on each other though bert lives on the platte and hicks on the big blue the automobile roads between those two rivers are excellent bert is the same sweettempered boy he was when he left his mothers kitchen his gravest troubles have been frequent betrothals but hicks round chubby face has taken on a slightly cynical expressiona look quite out of place there the chances of war have hurt his feelings not that he ever wanted anything for himself the way in which glittering honours bump down upon the wrong heads in the army and palms and crosses blossom on the wrong breasts has as he says thrown his compass off a few points what hicks had wanted most in this world was to run a garage and repair shop with his old chum dell able beaufort ended all that he means to conduct a sort of memorial shop anyhow with hicks and able over the door he wants to roll up his sleeves and look at the logical and beautiful inwards of automobiles for the rest of his life as the transport enters the north river sirens and steam whistles all along the water front begin to blow their shrill salute to the returning soldiers the men square their shoulders and smile knowingly at one another some of them look a little bored hicks slowly lights a cigarette and regards the end of it with an expression which will puzzle his friends when he gets home by the banks of lovely creek where it began claude wheelers story still goes on to the two old women who work together in the farmhouse the thought of him is always there beyond everything else at the farthest edge of consciousness like the evening sun on the horizon mrs wheeler got the word of his death one afternoon in the sittingroom the room in which he had bade her goodbye she was reading when the telephone rang is this the wheeler farm this is the telegraph office at frankfort we have a message from the war department the voice hesitated isnt mr wheeler there no but you can read the message to me mrs wheeler said thank you and hung up the receiver she felt her way softly to her chair she had an hour alone when there was nothing but him in the roombut him and the map there which was the end of his road somewhere among those perplexing names he had found his place claudes letters kept coming for weeks afterward then came the letters from his comrades and his colonel to tell her all in the dark months that followed when human nature looked to her uglier than it had ever done before those letters were mrs wheelers comfort as she read the newspapers she used to think about the passage of the red sea in the bible it seemed as if the flood of meanness and greed had been held back just long enough for the boys to go over and then swept down and engulfed everything that was left at home when she can see nothing that has come of it all but evil she reads claudes letters over again and reassures herself for him the call was clear the cause was glorious never a doubt stained his bright faith she divines so much that he did not write she knows what to read into those short flashes of enthusiasm how fully he must have found his life before he could let himself go so farhe who was so afraid of being fooled he died believing his own country better than it is and france better than any country can ever be and those were beautiful beliefs to die with perhaps it was as well to see that vision and then to see no more she would have dreaded the awakeningshe sometimes even doubts whether he could have borne at all that last desolating disappointment one by one the heroes of that war the men of dazzling soldiership leave prematurely the world they have come back to airmen whose deeds were tales of wonder officers whose names made the blood of youth beat faster survivors of incredible dangersone by one they quietly die by their own hand some do it in obscure lodging houses some in their office where they seemed to be carrying on their business like other men some slip over a vessels side and disappear into the sea when claudes mother hears of these things she shudders and presses her hands tight over her breast as if she had him there she feels as if god had saved him from some horrible suffering some horrible end for as she reads she thinks those slayers of themselves were all so like him they were the ones who had hoped extravagantlywho in order to do what they did had to hope extravagantly and to believe passionately and they found they had hoped and believed too much but one she knew who could ill bear disillusion safe safe mahailey when they are alone sometimes addresses mrs wheeler as mudder now mudder you go upstairs an lay down an rest yourself mrs wheeler knows that then she is thinking of claude is speaking for claude as they are working at the table or bending over the oven something reminds them of him and they think of him together like one person mahailey will pat her back and say never you mind mudder youll see your boy up yonder mrs wheeler always feels that god is nearbut mahailey is not troubled by any knowledge of interstellar spaces and for her he is nearer stilldirectly overhead not so very far above the kitchen stove
