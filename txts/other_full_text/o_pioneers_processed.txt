one january day thirty years ago the little town of hanover anchored on a windy nebraska tableland was trying not to be blown away a mist of fine snowflakes was curling and eddying about the cluster of low drab buildings huddled on the gray prairie under a gray sky the dwellinghouses were set about haphazard on the tough prairie sod some of them looked as if they had been moved in overnight and others as if they were straying off by themselves headed straight for the open plain none of them had any appearance of permanence and the howling wind blew under them as well as over them the main street was a deeply rutted road now frozen hard which ran from the squat red railway station and the grain elevator at the north end of the town to the lumber yard and the horse pond at the south end on either side of this road straggled two uneven rows of wooden buildings the general merchandise stores the two banks the drug store the feed store the saloon the postoffice the board sidewalks were gray with trampled snow but at two oclock in the afternoon the shopkeepers having come back from dinner were keeping well behind their frosty windows the children were all in school and there was nobody abroad in the streets but a few roughlooking countrymen in coarse overcoats with their long caps pulled down to their noses some of them had brought their wives to town and now and then a red or a plaid shawl flashed out of one store into the shelter of another at the hitchbars along the street a few heavy workhorses harnessed to farm wagons shivered under their blankets about the station everything was quiet for there would not be another train in until night on the sidewalk in front of one of the stores sat a little swede boy crying bitterly he was about five years old his black cloth coat was much too big for him and made him look like a little old man his shrunken brown flannel dress had been washed many times and left a long stretch of stocking between the hem of his skirt and the tops of his clumsy coppertoed shoes his cap was pulled down over his ears his nose and his chubby cheeks were chapped and red with cold he cried quietly and the few people who hurried by did not notice him he was afraid to stop any one afraid to go into the store and ask for help so he sat wringing his long sleeves and looking up a telegraph pole beside him whimpering my kitten oh my kitten her will fweeze at the top of the pole crouched a shivering gray kitten mewing faintly and clinging desperately to the wood with her claws the boy had been left at the store while his sister went to the doctors office and in her absence a dog had chased his kitten up the pole the little creature had never been so high before and she was too frightened to move her master was sunk in despair he was a little country boy and this village was to him a very strange and perplexing place where people wore fine clothes and had hard hearts he always felt shy and awkward here and wanted to hide behind things for fear some one might laugh at him just now he was too unhappy to care who laughed at last he seemed to see a ray of hope his sister was coming and he got up and ran toward her in his heavy shoes his sister was a tall strong girl and she walked rapidly and resolutely as if she knew exactly where she was going and what she was going to do next she wore a mans long ulster not as if it were an affliction but as if it were very comfortable and belonged to her carried it like a young soldier and a round plush cap tied down with a thick veil she had a serious thoughtful face and her clear deep blue eyes were fixed intently on the distance without seeming to see anything as if she were in trouble she did not notice the little boy until he pulled her by the coat then she stopped short and stooped down to wipe his wet face why emil i told you to stay in the store and not to come out what is the matter with you my kitten sister my kitten a man put her out and a dog chased her up there his forefinger projecting from the sleeve of his coat pointed up to the wretched little creature on the pole oh emil didnt i tell you shed get us into trouble of some kind if you brought her what made you tease me so but there i ought to have known better myself she went to the foot of the pole and held out her arms crying kitty kitty kitty but the kitten only mewed and faintly waved its tail alexandra turned away decidedly no she wont come down somebody will have to go up after her i saw the linstrums wagon in town ill go and see if i can find carl maybe he can do something only you must stop crying or i wont go a step wheres your comforter did you leave it in the store never mind hold still till i put this on you she unwound the brown veil from her head and tied it about his throat a shabby little traveling man who was just then coming out of the store on his way to the saloon stopped and gazed stupidly at the shining mass of hair she bared when she took off her veil two thick braids pinned about her head in the german way with a fringe of reddishyellow curls blowing out from under her cap he took his cigar out of his mouth and held the wet end between the fingers of his woolen glove my god girl what a head of hair he exclaimed quite innocently and foolishly she stabbed him with a glance of amazonian fierceness and drew in her lower lipmost unnecessary severity it gave the little clothing drummer such a start that he actually let his cigar fall to the sidewalk and went off weakly in the teeth of the wind to the saloon his hand was still unsteady when he took his glass from the bartender his feeble flirtatious instincts had been crushed before but never so mercilessly he felt cheap and illused as if some one had taken advantage of him when a drummer had been knocking about in little drab towns and crawling across the wintry country in dirty smokingcars was he to be blamed if when he chanced upon a fine human creature he suddenly wished himself more of a man while the little drummer was drinking to recover his nerve alexandra hurried to the drug store as the most likely place to find carl linstrum there he was turning over a portfolio of chromo studies which the druggist sold to the hanover women who did chinapainting alexandra explained her predicament and the boy followed her to the corner where emil still sat by the pole ill have to go up after her alexandra i think at the depot they have some spikes i can strap on my feet wait a minute carl thrust his hands into his pockets lowered his head and darted up the street against the north wind he was a tall boy of fifteen slight and narrowchested when he came back with the spikes alexandra asked him what he had done with his overcoat i left it in the drug store i couldnt climb in it anyhow catch me if i fall emil he called back as he began his ascent alexandra watched him anxiously the cold was bitter enough on the ground the kitten would not budge an inch carl had to go to the very top of the pole and then had some difficulty in tearing her from her hold when he reached the ground he handed the cat to her tearful little master now go into the store with her emil and get warm he opened the door for the child wait a minute alexandra why cant i drive for you as far as our place its getting colder every minute have you seen the doctor yes he is coming over tomorrow but he says father cant get better cant get well the girls lip trembled she looked fixedly up the bleak street as if she were gathering her strength to face something as if she were trying with all her might to grasp a situation which no matter how painful must be met and dealt with somehow the wind flapped the skirts of her heavy coat about her carl did not say anything but she felt his sympathy he too was lonely he was a thin frail boy with brooding dark eyes very quiet in all his movements there was a delicate pallor in his thin face and his mouth was too sensitive for a boys the lips had already a little curl of bitterness and skepticism the two friends stood for a few moments on the windy street corner not speaking a word as two travelers who have lost their way sometimes stand and admit their perplexity in silence when carl turned away he said ill see to your team alexandra went into the store to have her purchases packed in the eggboxes and to get warm before she set out on her long cold drive when she looked for emil she found him sitting on a step of the staircase that led up to the clothing and carpet department he was playing with a little bohemian girl marie tovesky who was tying her handkerchief over the kittens head for a bonnet marie was a stranger in the country having come from omaha with her mother to visit her uncle joe tovesky she was a dark child with brown curly hair like a brunette dolls a coaxing little red mouth and round yellowbrown eyes every one noticed her eyes the brown iris had golden glints that made them look like goldstone or in softer lights like that colorado mineral called tigereye the country children thereabouts wore their dresses to their shoetops but this city child was dressed in what was then called the kate greenaway manner and her red cashmere frock gathered full from the yoke came almost to the floor this with her poke bonnet gave her the look of a quaint little woman she had a white fur tippet about her neck and made no fussy objections when emil fingered it admiringly alexandra had not the heart to take him away from so pretty a playfellow and she let them tease the kitten together until joe tovesky came in noisily and picked up his little niece setting her on his shoulder for every one to see his children were all boys and he adored this little creature his cronies formed a circle about him admiring and teasing the little girl who took their jokes with great good nature they were all delighted with her for they seldom saw so pretty and carefully nurtured a child they told her that she must choose one of them for a sweetheart and each began pressing his suit and offering her bribes candy and little pigs and spotted calves she looked archly into the big brown mustached faces smelling of spirits and tobacco then she ran her tiny forefinger delicately over joes bristly chin and said here is my sweetheart the bohemians roared with laughter and maries uncle hugged her until she cried please dont uncle joe you hurt me each of joes friends gave her a bag of candy and she kissed them all around though she did not like country candy very well perhaps that was why she bethought herself of emil let me down uncle joe she said i want to give some of my candy to that nice little boy i found she walked graciously over to emil followed by her lusty admirers who formed a new circle and teased the little boy until he hid his face in his sisters skirts and she had to scold him for being such a baby the farm people were making preparations to start for home the women were checking over their groceries and pinning their big red shawls about their heads the men were buying tobacco and candy with what money they had left were showing each other new boots and gloves and blue flannel shirts three big bohemians were drinking raw alcohol tinctured with oil of cinnamon this was said to fortify one effectually against the cold and they smacked their lips after each pull at the flask their volubility drowned every other noise in the place and the overheated store sounded of their spirited language as it reeked of pipe smoke damp woolens and kerosene carl came in wearing his overcoat and carrying a wooden box with a brass handle come he said ive fed and watered your team and the wagon is ready he carried emil out and tucked him down in the straw in the wagonbox the heat had made the little boy sleepy but he still clung to his kitten you were awful good to climb so high and get my kitten carl when i get big ill climb and get little boys kittens for them he murmured drowsily before the horses were over the first hill emil and his cat were both fast asleep although it was only four oclock the winter day was fading the road led southwest toward the streak of pale watery light that glimmered in the leaden sky the light fell upon the two sad young faces that were turned mutely toward it upon the eyes of the girl who seemed to be looking with such anguished perplexity into the future upon the sombre eyes of the boy who seemed already to be looking into the past the little town behind them had vanished as if it had never been had fallen behind the swell of the prairie and the stern frozen country received them into its bosom the homesteads were few and far apart here and there a windmill gaunt against the sky a sod house crouching in a hollow but the great fact was the land itself which seemed to overwhelm the little beginnings of human society that struggled in its sombre wastes it was from facing this vast hardness that the boys mouth had become so bitter because he felt that men were too weak to make any mark here that the land wanted to be let alone to preserve its own fierce strength its peculiar savage kind of beauty its uninterrupted mournfulness the wagon jolted along over the frozen road the two friends had less to say to each other than usual as if the cold had somehow penetrated to their hearts did lou and oscar go to the blue to cut wood today carl asked yes im almost sorry i let them go its turned so cold but mother frets if the wood gets low she stopped and put her hand to her forehead brushing back her hair i dont know what is to become of us carl if father has to die i dont dare to think about it i wish we could all go with him and let the grass grow back over everything carl made no reply just ahead of them was the norwegian graveyard where the grass had indeed grown back over everything shaggy and red hiding even the wire fence carl realized that he was not a very helpful companion but there was nothing he could say of course alexandra went on steadying her voice a little the boys are strong and work hard but weve always depended so on father that i dont see how we can go ahead i almost feel as if there were nothing to go ahead for does your father know yes i think he does he lies and counts on his fingers all day i think he is trying to count up what he is leaving for us its a comfort to him that my chickens are laying right on through the cold weather and bringing in a little money i wish we could keep his mind off such things but i dont have much time to be with him now i wonder if hed like to have me bring my magic lantern over some evening alexandra turned her face toward him oh carl have you got it yes its back there in the straw didnt you notice the box i was carrying i tried it all morning in the drugstore cellar and it worked ever so well makes fine big pictures what are they about oh hunting pictures in germany and robinson crusoe and funny pictures about cannibals im going to paint some slides for it on glass out of the hans andersen book alexandra seemed actually cheered there is often a good deal of the child left in people who have had to grow up too soon do bring it over carl i can hardly wait to see it and im sure it will please father are the pictures colored then i know hell like them he likes the calendars i get him in town i wish i could get more you must leave me here mustnt you its been nice to have company carl stopped the horses and looked dubiously up at the black sky its pretty dark of course the horses will take you home but i think id better light your lantern in case you should need it he gave her the reins and climbed back into the wagonbox where he crouched down and made a tent of his overcoat after a dozen trials he succeeded in lighting the lantern which he placed in front of alexandra half covering it with a blanket so that the light would not shine in her eyes now wait until i find my box yes here it is goodnight alexandra try not to worry carl sprang to the ground and ran off across the fields toward the linstrum homestead hoo hooooo he called back as he disappeared over a ridge and dropped into a sand gully the wind answered him like an echo hoo hooooooo alexandra drove off alone the rattle of her wagon was lost in the howling of the wind but her lantern held firmly between her feet made a moving point of light along the highway going deeper and deeper into the dark country ii on one of the ridges of that wintry waste stood the low log house in which john bergson was dying the bergson homestead was easier to find than many another because it overlooked norway creek a shallow muddy stream that sometimes flowed and sometimes stood still at the bottom of a winding ravine with steep shelving sides overgrown with brush and cottonwoods and dwarf ash this creek gave a sort of identity to the farms that bordered upon it of all the bewildering things about a new country the absence of human landmarks is one of the most depressing and disheartening the houses on the divide were small and were usually tucked away in low places you did not see them until you came directly upon them most of them were built of the sod itself and were only the unescapable ground in another form the roads were but faint tracks in the grass and the fields were scarcely noticeable the record of the plow was insignificant like the feeble scratches on stone left by prehistoric races so indeterminate that they may after all be only the markings of glaciers and not a record of human strivings in eleven long years john bergson had made but little impression upon the wild land he had come to tame it was still a wild thing that had its ugly moods and no one knew when they were likely to come or why mischance hung over it its genius was unfriendly to man the sick man was feeling this as he lay looking out of the window after the doctor had left him on the day following alexandras trip to town there it lay outside his door the same land the same leadcolored miles he knew every ridge and draw and gully between him and the horizon to the south his plowed fields to the east the sod stables the cattle corral the pondand then the grass bergson went over in his mind the things that had held him back one winter his cattle had perished in a blizzard the next summer one of his plow horses broke its leg in a prairiedog hole and had to be shot another summer he lost his hogs from cholera and a valuable stallion died from a rattlesnake bite time and again his crops had failed he had lost two children boys that came between lou and emil and there had been the cost of sickness and death now when he had at last struggled out of debt he was going to die himself he was only fortysix and had of course counted upon more time bergson had spent his first five years on the divide getting into debt and the last six getting out he had paid off his mortgages and had ended pretty much where he began with the land he owned exactly six hundred and forty acres of what stretched outside his door his own original homestead and timber claim making three hundred and twenty acres and the halfsection adjoining the homestead of a younger brother who had given up the fight gone back to chicago to work in a fancy bakery and distinguish himself in a swedish athletic club so far john had not attempted to cultivate the second halfsection but used it for pasture land and one of his sons rode herd there in open weather john bergson had the oldworld belief that land in itself is desirable but this land was an enigma it was like a horse that no one knows how to break to harness that runs wild and kicks things to pieces he had an idea that no one understood how to farm it properly and this he often discussed with alexandra their neighbors certainly knew even less about farming than he did many of them had never worked on a farm until they took up their homesteads they had been handwerkers at home tailors locksmiths joiners cigarmakers etc bergson himself had worked in a shipyard for weeks john bergson had been thinking about these things his bed stood in the sittingroom next to the kitchen through the day while the baking and washing and ironing were going on the father lay and looked up at the roof beams that he himself had hewn or out at the cattle in the corral he counted the cattle over and over it diverted him to speculate as to how much weight each of the steers would probably put on by spring he often called his daughter in to talk to her about this before alexandra was twelve years old she had begun to be a help to him and as she grew older he had come to depend more and more upon her resourcefulness and good judgment his boys were willing enough to work but when he talked with them they usually irritated him it was alexandra who read the papers and followed the markets and who learned by the mistakes of their neighbors it was alexandra who could always tell about what it had cost to fatten each steer and who could guess the weight of a hog before it went on the scales closer than john bergson himself lou and oscar were industrious but he could never teach them to use their heads about their work alexandra her father often said to himself was like her grandfather which was his way of saying that she was intelligent john bergsons father had been a shipbuilder a man of considerable force and of some fortune late in life he married a second time a stockholm woman of questionable character much younger than he who goaded him into every sort of extravagance on the shipbuilders part this marriage was an infatuation the despairing folly of a powerful man who cannot bear to grow old in a few years his unprincipled wife warped the probity of a lifetime he speculated lost his own fortune and funds entrusted to him by poor seafaring men and died disgraced leaving his children nothing but when all was said he had come up from the sea himself had built up a proud little business with no capital but his own skill and foresight and had proved himself a man in his daughter john bergson recognized the strength of will and the simple direct way of thinking things out that had characterized his father in his better days he would much rather of course have seen this likeness in one of his sons but it was not a question of choice as he lay there day after day he had to accept the situation as it was and to be thankful that there was one among his children to whom he could entrust the future of his family and the possibilities of his hardwon land the winter twilight was fading the sick man heard his wife strike a match in the kitchen and the light of a lamp glimmered through the cracks of the door it seemed like a light shining far away he turned painfully in his bed and looked at his white hands with all the work gone out of them he was ready to give up he felt he did not know how it had come about but he was quite willing to go deep under his fields and rest where the plow could not find him he was tired of making mistakes he was content to leave the tangle to other hands he thought of his alexandras strong ones dotter he called feebly dotter he heard her quick step and saw her tall figure appear in the doorway with the light of the lamp behind her he felt her youth and strength how easily she moved and stooped and lifted but he would not have had it again if he could not he he knew the end too well to wish to begin again he knew where it all went to what it all became his daughter came and lifted him up on his pillows she called him by an old swedish name that she used to call him when she was little and took his dinner to him in the shipyard tell the boys to come here daughter i want to speak to them they are feeding the horses father they have just come back from the blue shall i call them he sighed no no wait until they come in alexandra you will have to do the best you can for your brothers everything will come on you i will do all i can father dont let them get discouraged and go off like uncle otto i want them to keep the land we will father we will never lose the land there was a sound of heavy feet in the kitchen alexandra went to the door and beckoned to her brothers two strapping boys of seventeen and nineteen they came in and stood at the foot of the bed their father looked at them searchingly though it was too dark to see their faces they were just the same boys he told himself he had not been mistaken in them the square head and heavy shoulders belonged to oscar the elder the younger boy was quicker but vacillating boys said the father wearily i want you to keep the land together and to be guided by your sister i have talked to her since i have been sick and she knows all my wishes i want no quarrels among my children and so long as there is one house there must be one head alexandra is the oldest and she knows my wishes she will do the best she can if she makes mistakes she will not make so many as i have made when you marry and want a house of your own the land will be divided fairly according to the courts but for the next few years you will have it hard and you must all keep together alexandra will manage the best she can oscar who was usually the last to speak replied because he was the older yes father it would be so anyway without your speaking we will all work the place together and you will be guided by your sister boys and be good brothers to her and good sons to your mother that is good and alexandra must not work in the fields any more there is no necessity now hire a man when you need help she can make much more with her eggs and butter than the wages of a man it was one of my mistakes that i did not find that out sooner try to break a little more land every year sod corn is good for fodder keep turning the land and always put up more hay than you need dont grudge your mother a little time for plowing her garden and setting out fruit trees even if it comes in a busy season she has been a good mother to you and she has always missed the old country when they went back to the kitchen the boys sat down silently at the table throughout the meal they looked down at their plates and did not lift their red eyes they did not eat much although they had been working in the cold all day and there was a rabbit stewed in gravy for supper and prune pies john bergson had married beneath him but he had married a good housewife mrs bergson was a fairskinned corpulent woman heavy and placid like her son oscar but there was something comfortable about her perhaps it was her own love of comfort for eleven years she had worthily striven to maintain some semblance of household order amid conditions that made order very difficult habit was very strong with mrs bergson and her unremitting efforts to repeat the routine of her old life among new surroundings had done a great deal to keep the family from disintegrating morally and getting careless in their ways the bergsons had a log house for instance only because mrs bergson would not live in a sod house she missed the fish diet of her own country and twice every summer she sent the boys to the river twenty miles to the southward to fish for channel cat when the children were little she used to load them all into the wagon the baby in its crib and go fishing herself alexandra often said that if her mother were cast upon a desert island she would thank god for her deliverance make a garden and find something to preserve preserving was almost a mania with mrs bergson stout as she was she roamed the scrubby banks of norway creek looking for fox grapes and goose plums like a wild creature in search of prey she made a yellow jam of the insipid groundcherries that grew on the prairie flavoring it with lemon peel and she made a sticky dark conserve of garden tomatoes she had experimented even with the rank buffalopea and she could not see a fine bronze cluster of them without shaking her head and murmuring what a pity when there was nothing more to preserve she began to pickle the amount of sugar she used in these processes was sometimes a serious drain upon the family resources she was a good mother but she was glad when her children were old enough not to be in her way in the kitchen she had never quite forgiven john bergson for bringing her to the end of the earth but now that she was there she wanted to be let alone to reconstruct her old life in so far as that was possible she could still take some comfort in the world if she had bacon in the cave glass jars on the shelves and sheets in the press she disapproved of all her neighbors because of their slovenly housekeeping and the women thought her very proud once when mrs bergson on her way to norway creek stopped to see old mrs lee the old woman hid in the haymow for fear mis bergson would catch her barefoot iii one sunday afternoon in july six months after john bergsons death carl was sitting in the doorway of the linstrum kitchen dreaming over an illustrated paper when he heard the rattle of a wagon along the hill road looking up he recognized the bergsons team with two seats in the wagon which meant they were off for a pleasure excursion oscar and lou on the front seat wore their cloth hats and coats never worn except on sundays and emil on the second seat with alexandra sat proudly in his new trousers made from a pair of his fathers and a pinkstriped shirt with a wide ruffled collar oscar stopped the horses and waved to carl who caught up his hat and ran through the melon patch to join them want to go with us lou called were going to crazy ivars to buy a hammock sure carl ran up panting and clambering over the wheel sat down beside emil ive always wanted to see ivars pond they say its the biggest in all the country arent you afraid to go to ivars in that new shirt emil he might want it and take it right off your back emil grinned id be awful scared to go he admitted if you big boys werent along to take care of me did you ever hear him howl carl people say sometimes he runs about the country howling at night because he is afraid the lord will destroy him mother thinks he must have done something awful wicked lou looked back and winked at carl what would you do emil if you was out on the prairie by yourself and seen him coming emil stared maybe i could hide in a badgerhole he suggested doubtfully but suppose there wasnt any badgerhole lou persisted would you run no id be too scared to run emil admitted mournfully twisting his fingers i guess id sit right down on the ground and say my prayers the big boys laughed and oscar brandished his whip over the broad backs of the horses he wouldnt hurt you emil said carl persuasively he came to doctor our mare when she ate green corn and swelled up most as big as the watertank he petted her just like you do your cats i couldnt understand much he said for he dont talk any english but he kept patting her and groaning as if he had the pain himself and saying there now sister thats easier thats better lou and oscar laughed and emil giggled delightedly and looked up at his sister i dont think he knows anything at all about doctoring said oscar scornfully they say when horses have distemper he takes the medicine himself and then prays over the horses alexandra spoke up thats what the crows said but he cured their horses all the same some days his mind is cloudy like but if you can get him on a clear day you can learn a great deal from him he understands animals didnt i see him take the horn off the berquists cow when she had torn it loose and went crazy she was tearing all over the place knocking herself against things and at last she ran out on the roof of the old dugout and her legs went through and there she stuck bellowing ivar came running with his white bag and the moment he got to her she was quiet and let him saw her horn off and daub the place with tar emil had been watching his sister his face reflecting the sufferings of the cow and then didnt it hurt her any more he asked alexandra patted him no not any more and in two days they could use her milk again the road to ivars homestead was a very poor one he had settled in the rough country across the county line where no one lived but some russianshalf a dozen families who dwelt together in one long house divided off like barracks ivar had explained his choice by saying that the fewer neighbors he had the fewer temptations nevertheless when one considered that his chief business was horsedoctoring it seemed rather shortsighted of him to live in the most inaccessible place he could find the bergson wagon lurched along over the rough hummocks and grass banks followed the bottom of winding draws or skirted the margin of wide lagoons where the golden coreopsis grew up out of the clear water and the wild ducks rose with a whirr of wings lou looked after them helplessly i wish id brought my gun anyway alexandra he said fretfully i could have hidden it under the straw in the bottom of the wagon then wed have had to lie to ivar besides they say he can smell dead birds and if he knew we wouldnt get anything out of him not even a hammock i want to talk to him and he wont talk sense if hes angry it makes him foolish lou sniffed whoever heard of him talking sense anyhow id rather have ducks for supper than crazy ivars tongue emil was alarmed oh but lou you dont want to make him mad he might howl they all laughed again and oscar urged the horses up the crumbling side of a clay bank they had left the lagoons and the red grass behind them in crazy ivars country the grass was short and gray the draws deeper than they were in the bergsons neighborhood and the land was all broken up into hillocks and clay ridges the wild flowers disappeared and only in the bottom of the draws and gullies grew a few of the very toughest and hardiest shoestring and ironweed and snowonthemountain look look emil theres ivars big pond alexandra pointed to a shining sheet of water that lay at the bottom of a shallow draw at one end of the pond was an earthen dam planted with green willow bushes and above it a door and a single window were set into the hillside you would not have seen them at all but for the reflection of the sunlight upon the four panes of windowglass and that was all you saw not a shed not a corral not a well not even a path broken in the curly grass but for the piece of rusty stovepipe sticking up through the sod you could have walked over the roof of ivars dwelling without dreaming that you were near a human habitation ivar had lived for three years in the clay bank without defiling the face of nature any more than the coyote that had lived there before him had done when the bergsons drove over the hill ivar was sitting in the doorway of his house reading the norwegian bible he was a queerly shaped old man with a thick powerful body set on short bowlegs his shaggy white hair falling in a thick mane about his ruddy cheeks made him look older than he was he was barefoot but he wore a clean shirt of unbleached cotton open at the neck he always put on a clean shirt when sunday morning came round though he never went to church he had a peculiar religion of his own and could not get on with any of the denominations often he did not see anybody from one weeks end to another he kept a calendar and every morning he checked off a day so that he was never in any doubt as to which day of the week it was ivar hired himself out in threshing and cornhusking time and he doctored sick animals when he was sent for when he was at home he made hammocks out of twine and committed chapters of the bible to memory ivar found contentment in the solitude he had sought out for himself he disliked the litter of human dwellings the broken food the bits of broken china the old washboilers and teakettles thrown into the sunflower patch he preferred the cleanness and tidiness of the wild sod he always said that the badgers had cleaner houses than people and that when he took a housekeeper her name would be mrs badger he best expressed his preference for his wild homestead by saying that his bible seemed truer to him there if one stood in the doorway of his cave and looked off at the rough land the smiling sky the curly grass white in the hot sunlight if one listened to the rapturous song of the lark the drumming of the quail the burr of the locust against that vast silence one understood what ivar meant on this sunday afternoon his face shone with happiness he closed the book on his knee keeping the place with his horny finger and repeated softly he sendeth the springs into the valleys which run among the hills they give drink to every beast of the field the wild asses quench their thirst the trees of the lord are full of sap the cedars of lebanon which he hath planted where the birds make their nests as for the stork the fir trees are her house the high hills are a refuge for the wild goats and the rocks for the conies before he opened his bible again ivar heard the bergsons wagon approaching and he sprang up and ran toward it no guns no guns he shouted waving his arms distractedly no ivar no guns alexandra called reassuringly he dropped his arms and went up to the wagon smiling amiably and looking at them out of his pale blue eyes we want to buy a hammock if you have one alexandra explained and my little brother here wants to see your big pond where so many birds come ivar smiled foolishly and began rubbing the horses noses and feeling about their mouths behind the bits not many birds just now a few ducks this morning and some snipe come to drink but there was a crane last week she spent one night and came back the next evening i dont know why it is not her season of course many of them go over in the fall then the pond is full of strange voices every night alexandra translated for carl who looked thoughtful ask him alexandra if it is true that a sea gull came here once i have heard so she had some difficulty in making the old man understand he looked puzzled at first then smote his hands together as he remembered oh yes yes a big white bird with long wings and pink feet my what a voice she had she came in the afternoon and kept flying about the pond and screaming until dark she was in trouble of some sort but i could not understand her she was going over to the other ocean maybe and did not know how far it was she was afraid of never getting there she was more mournful than our birds here she cried in the night she saw the light from my window and darted up to it maybe she thought my house was a boat she was such a wild thing next morning when the sun rose i went out to take her food but she flew up into the sky and went on her way ivar ran his fingers through his thick hair i have many strange birds stop with me here they come from very far away and are great company i hope you boys never shoot wild birds lou and oscar grinned and ivar shook his bushy head yes i know boys are thoughtless but these wild things are gods birds he watches over them and counts them as we do our cattle christ says so in the new testament now ivar lou asked may we water our horses at your pond and give them some feed its a bad road to your place yes yes it is the old man scrambled about and began to loose the tugs a bad road eh girls and the bay with a colt at home oscar brushed the old man aside well take care of the horses ivar youll be finding some disease on them alexandra wants to see your hammocks ivar led alexandra and emil to his little cave house he had but one room neatly plastered and whitewashed and there was a wooden floor there was a kitchen stove a table covered with oilcloth two chairs a clock a calendar a few books on the windowshelf nothing more but the place was as clean as a cupboard but where do you sleep ivar emil asked looking about ivar unslung a hammock from a hook on the wall in it was rolled a buffalo robe there my son a hammock is a good bed and in winter i wrap up in this skin where i go to work the beds are not half so easy as this by this time emil had lost all his timidity he thought a cave a very superior kind of house there was something pleasantly unusual about it and about ivar do the birds know you will be kind to them ivar is that why so many come he asked ivar sat down on the floor and tucked his feet under him see little brother they have come from a long way and they are very tired from up there where they are flying our country looks dark and flat they must have water to drink and to bathe in before they can go on with their journey they look this way and that and far below them they see something shining like a piece of glass set in the dark earth that is my pond they come to it and are not disturbed maybe i sprinkle a little corn they tell the other birds and next year more come this way they have their roads up there as we have down here emil rubbed his knees thoughtfully and is that true ivar about the head ducks falling back when they are tired and the hind ones taking their place yes the point of the wedge gets the worst of it they cut the wind they can only stand it there a little whilehalf an hour maybe then they fall back and the wedge splits a little while the rear ones come up the middle to the front then it closes up and they fly on with a new edge they are always changing like that up in the air never any confusion just like soldiers who have been drilled alexandra had selected her hammock by the time the boys came up from the pond they would not come in but sat in the shade of the bank outside while alexandra and ivar talked about the birds and about his housekeeping and why he never ate meat fresh or salt alexandra was sitting on one of the wooden chairs her arms resting on the table ivar was sitting on the floor at her feet ivar she said suddenly beginning to trace the pattern on the oilcloth with her forefinger i came today more because i wanted to talk to you than because i wanted to buy a hammock yes the old man scraped his bare feet on the plank floor we have a big bunch of hogs ivar i wouldnt sell in the spring when everybody advised me to and now so many people are losing their hogs that i am frightened what can be done ivars little eyes began to shine they lost their vagueness you feed them swill and such stuff of course and sour milk oh yes and keep them in a stinking pen i tell you sister the hogs of this country are put upon they become unclean like the hogs in the bible if you kept your chickens like that what would happen you have a little sorghum patch maybe put a fence around it and turn the hogs in build a shed to give them shade a thatch on poles let the boys haul water to them in barrels clean water and plenty get them off the old stinking ground and do not let them go back there until winter give them only grain and clean feed such as you would give horses or cattle hogs do not like to be filthy the boys outside the door had been listening lou nudged his brother come the horses are done eating lets hitch up and get out of here hell fill her full of notions shell be for having the pigs sleep with us next oscar grunted and got up carl who could not understand what ivar said saw that the two boys were displeased they did not mind hard work but they hated experiments and could never see the use of taking pains even lou who was more elastic than his older brother disliked to do anything different from their neighbors he felt that it made them conspicuous and gave people a chance to talk about them once they were on the homeward road the boys forgot their illhumor and joked about ivar and his birds alexandra did not propose any reforms in the care of the pigs and they hoped she had forgotten ivars talk they agreed that he was crazier than ever and would never be able to prove up on his land because he worked it so little alexandra privately resolved that she would have a talk with ivar about this and stir him up the boys persuaded carl to stay for supper and go swimming in the pasture pond after dark that evening after she had washed the supper dishes alexandra sat down on the kitchen doorstep while her mother was mixing the bread it was a still deepbreathing summer night full of the smell of the hay fields sounds of laughter and splashing came up from the pasture and when the moon rose rapidly above the bare rim of the prairie the pond glittered like polished metal and she could see the flash of white bodies as the boys ran about the edge or jumped into the water alexandra watched the shimmering pool dreamily but eventually her eyes went back to the sorghum patch south of the barn where she was planning to make her new pig corral iv for the first three years after john bergsons death the affairs of his family prospered then came the hard times that brought every one on the divide to the brink of despair three years of drouth and failure the last struggle of a wild soil against the encroaching plowshare the first of these fruitless summers the bergson boys bore courageously the failure of the corn crop made labor cheap lou and oscar hired two men and put in bigger crops than ever before they lost everything they spent the whole country was discouraged farmers who were already in debt had to give up their land a few foreclosures demoralized the county the settlers sat about on the wooden sidewalks in the little town and told each other that the country was never meant for men to live in the thing to do was to get back to iowa to illinois to any place that had been proved habitable the bergson boys certainly would have been happier with their uncle otto in the bakery shop in chicago like most of their neighbors they were meant to follow in paths already marked out for them not to break trails in a new country a steady job a few holidays nothing to think about and they would have been very happy it was no fault of theirs that they had been dragged into the wilderness when they were little boys a pioneer should have imagination should be able to enjoy the idea of things more than the things themselves the second of these barren summers was passing one september afternoon alexandra had gone over to the garden across the draw to dig sweet potatoesthey had been thriving upon the weather that was fatal to everything else but when carl linstrum came up the garden rows to find her she was not working she was standing lost in thought leaning upon her pitchfork her sunbonnet lying beside her on the ground the dry garden patch smelled of drying vines and was strewn with yellow seedcucumbers and pumpkins and citrons at one end next the rhubarb grew feathery asparagus with red berries down the middle of the garden was a row of gooseberry and currant bushes a few tough zenias and marigolds and a row of scarlet sage bore witness to the buckets of water that mrs bergson had carried there after sundown against the prohibition of her sons carl came quietly and slowly up the garden path looking intently at alexandra she did not hear him she was standing perfectly still with that serious ease so characteristic of her her thick reddish braids twisted about her head fairly burned in the sunlight the air was cool enough to make the warm sun pleasant on ones back and shoulders and so clear that the eye could follow a hawk up and up into the blazing blue depths of the sky even carl never a very cheerful boy and considerably darkened by these last two bitter years loved the country on days like this felt something strong and young and wild come out of it that laughed at care alexandra he said as he approached her i want to talk to you lets sit down by the gooseberry bushes he picked up her sack of potatoes and they crossed the garden boys gone to town he asked as he sank down on the warm sunbaked earth well we have made up our minds at last alexandra we are really going away she looked at him as if she were a little frightened really carl is it settled yes father has heard from st louis and they will give him back his old job in the cigar factory he must be there by the first of november they are taking on new men then we will sell the place for whatever we can get and auction the stock we havent enough to ship i am going to learn engraving with a german engraver there and then try to get work in chicago alexandras hands dropped in her lap her eyes became dreamy and filled with tears carls sensitive lower lip trembled he scratched in the soft earth beside him with a stick thats all i hate about it alexandra he said slowly youve stood by us through so much and helped father out so many times and now it seems as if we were running off and leaving you to face the worst of it but it isnt as if we could really ever be of any help to you we are only one more drag one more thing you look out for and feel responsible for father was never meant for a farmer you know that and i hate it wed only get in deeper and deeper yes yes carl i know you are wasting your life here you are able to do much better things you are nearly nineteen now and i wouldnt have you stay ive always hoped you would get away but i cant help feeling scared when i think how i will miss youmore than you will ever know she brushed the tears from her cheeks not trying to hide them but alexandra he said sadly and wistfully ive never been any real help to you beyond sometimes trying to keep the boys in a good humor alexandra smiled and shook her head oh its not that nothing like that its by understanding me and the boys and mother that youve helped me i expect that is the only way one person ever really can help another i think you are about the only one that ever helped me somehow it will take more courage to bear your going than everything that has happened before carl looked at the ground you see weve all depended so on you he said even father he makes me laugh when anything comes up he always says i wonder what the bergsons are going to do about that i guess ill go and ask her ill never forget that time when we first came here and our horse had the colic and i ran over to your placeyour father was away and you came home with me and showed father how to let the wind out of the horse you were only a little girl then but you knew ever so much more about farm work than poor father you remember how homesick i used to get and what long talks we used to have coming from school weve someway always felt alike about things yes thats it weve liked the same things and weve liked them together without anybody else knowing and weve had good times hunting for christmas trees and going for ducks and making our plum wine together every year weve never either of us had any other close friend and now alexandra wiped her eyes with the corner of her apron and now i must remember that you are going where you will have many friends and will find the work you were meant to do but youll write to me carl that will mean a great deal to me here ill write as long as i live cried the boy impetuously and ill be working for you as much as for myself alexandra i want to do something youll like and be proud of im a fool here but i know i can do something he sat up and frowned at the red grass alexandra sighed how discouraged the boys will be when they hear they always come home from town discouraged anyway so many people are trying to leave the country and they talk to our boys and make them lowspirited im afraid they are beginning to feel hard toward me because i wont listen to any talk about going sometimes i feel like im getting tired of standing up for this country i wont tell the boys yet if youd rather not oh ill tell them myself tonight when they come home theyll be talking wild anyway and no good comes of keeping bad news its all harder on them than it is on me lou wants to get married poor boy and he cant until times are better see there goes the sun carl i must be getting back mother will want her potatoes its chilly already the moment the light goes alexandra rose and looked about a golden afterglow throbbed in the west but the country already looked empty and mournful a dark moving mass came over the western hill the lee boy was bringing in the herd from the other halfsection emil ran from the windmill to open the corral gate from the log house on the little rise across the draw the smoke was curling the cattle lowed and bellowed in the sky the pale halfmoon was slowly silvering alexandra and carl walked together down the potato rows i have to keep telling myself what is going to happen she said softly since you have been here ten years now i have never really been lonely but i can remember what it was like before now i shall have nobody but emil but he is my boy and he is tenderhearted that night when the boys were called to supper they sat down moodily they had worn their coats to town but they ate in their striped shirts and suspenders they were grown men now and as alexandra said for the last few years they had been growing more and more like themselves lou was still the slighter of the two the quicker and more intelligent but apt to go off at halfcock he had a lively blue eye a thin fair skin always burned red to the neckband of his shirt in summer stiff yellow hair that would not lie down on his head and a bristly little yellow mustache of which he was very proud oscar could not grow a mustache his pale face was as bare as an egg and his white eyebrows gave it an empty look he was a man of powerful body and unusual endurance the sort of man you could attach to a cornsheller as you would an engine he would turn it all day without hurrying without slowing down but he was as indolent of mind as he was unsparing of his body his love of routine amounted to a vice he worked like an insect always doing the same thing over in the same way regardless of whether it was best or no he felt that there was a sovereign virtue in mere bodily toil and he rather liked to do things in the hardest way if a field had once been in corn he couldnt bear to put it into wheat he liked to begin his cornplanting at the same time every year whether the season were backward or forward he seemed to feel that by his own irreproachable regularity he would clear himself of blame and reprove the weather when the wheat crop failed he threshed the straw at a dead loss to demonstrate how little grain there was and thus prove his case against providence lou on the other hand was fussy and flighty always planned to get through two days work in one and often got only the least important things done he liked to keep the place up but he never got round to doing odd jobs until he had to neglect more pressing work to attend to them in the middle of the wheat harvest when the grain was overripe and every hand was needed he would stop to mend fences or to patch the harness then dash down to the field and overwork and be laid up in bed for a week the two boys balanced each other and they pulled well together they had been good friends since they were children one seldom went anywhere even to town without the other tonight after they sat down to supper oscar kept looking at lou as if he expected him to say something and lou blinked his eyes and frowned at his plate it was alexandra herself who at last opened the discussion the linstrums she said calmly as she put another plate of hot biscuit on the table are going back to st louis the old man is going to work in the cigar factory again at this lou plunged in you see alexandra everybody who can crawl out is going away theres no use of us trying to stick it out just to be stubborn theres something in knowing when to quit where do you want to go lou any place where things will grow said oscar grimly lou reached for a potato chris arnson has traded his halfsection for a place down on the river who did he trade with charley fuller in town fuller the real estate man you see lou that fuller has a head on him hes buying and trading for every bit of land he can get up here itll make him a rich man some day hes rich now thats why he can take a chance why cant we well live longer than he will some day the land itself will be worth more than all we can ever raise on it lou laughed it could be worth that and still not be worth much why alexandra you dont know what youre talking about our place wouldnt bring now what it would six years ago the fellows that settled up here just made a mistake now theyre beginning to see this high land wasnt never meant to grow nothing on and everybody who aint fixed to graze cattle is trying to crawl out its too high to farm up here all the americans are skinning out that man percy adams north of town told me that he was going to let fuller take his land and stuff for four hundred dollars and a ticket to chicago theres fuller again alexandra exclaimed i wish that man would take me for a partner hes feathering his nest if only poor people could learn a little from rich people but all these fellows who are running off are bad farmers like poor mr linstrum they couldnt get ahead even in good years and they all got into debt while father was getting out i think we ought to hold on as long as we can on fathers account he was so set on keeping this land he must have seen harder times than this here how was it in the early days mother mrs bergson was weeping quietly these family discussions always depressed her and made her remember all that she had been torn away from i dont see why the boys are always taking on about going away she said wiping her eyes i dont want to move again out to some raw place maybe where wed be worse off than we are here and all to do over again i wont move if the rest of you go i will ask some of the neighbors to take me in and stay and be buried by father im not going to leave him by himself on the prairie for cattle to run over she began to cry more bitterly the boys looked angry alexandra put a soothing hand on her mothers shoulder theres no question of that mother you dont have to go if you dont want to a third of the place belongs to you by american law and we cant sell without your consent we only want you to advise us how did it use to be when you and father first came was it really as bad as this or not oh worse much worse moaned mrs bergson drouth chincebugs hail everything my garden all cut to pieces like sauerkraut no grapes on the creek no nothing the people all lived just like coyotes oscar got up and tramped out of the kitchen lou followed him they felt that alexandra had taken an unfair advantage in turning their mother loose on them the next morning they were silent and reserved they did not offer to take the women to church but went down to the barn immediately after breakfast and stayed there all day when carl linstrum came over in the afternoon alexandra winked to him and pointed toward the barn he understood her and went down to play cards with the boys they believed that a very wicked thing to do on sunday and it relieved their feelings alexandra stayed in the house on sunday afternoon mrs bergson always took a nap and alexandra read during the week she read only the newspaper but on sunday and in the long evenings of winter she read a good deal read a few things over a great many times she knew long portions of the frithjof saga by heart and like most swedes who read at all she was fond of longfellows versethe ballads and the golden legend and the spanish student today she sat in the wooden rockingchair with the swedish bible open on her knees but she was not reading she was looking thoughtfully away at the point where the upland road disappeared over the rim of the prairie her body was in an attitude of perfect repose such as it was apt to take when she was thinking earnestly her mind was slow truthful steadfast she had not the least spark of cleverness all afternoon the sittingroom was full of quiet and sunlight emil was making rabbit traps in the kitchen shed the hens were clucking and scratching brown holes in the flower beds and the wind was teasing the princes feather by the door that evening carl came in with the boys to supper emil said alexandra when they were all seated at the table how would you like to go traveling because i am going to take a trip and you can go with me if you want to the boys looked up in amazement they were always afraid of alexandras schemes carl was interested ive been thinking boys she went on that maybe i am too set against making a change im going to take brigham and the buckboard tomorrow and drive down to the river country and spend a few days looking over what theyve got down there if i find anything good you boys can go down and make a trade nobody down there will trade for anything up here said oscar gloomily thats just what i want to find out maybe they are just as discontented down there as we are up here things away from home often look better than they are you know what your hans andersen book says carl about the swedes liking to buy danish bread and the danes liking to buy swedish bread because people always think the bread of another country is better than their own anyway ive heard so much about the river farms i wont be satisfied till ive seen for myself lou fidgeted look out dont agree to anything dont let them fool you lou was apt to be fooled himself he had not yet learned to keep away from the shellgame wagons that followed the circus after supper lou put on a necktie and went across the fields to court annie lee and carl and oscar sat down to a game of checkers while alexandra read the swiss family robinson aloud to her mother and emil it was not long before the two boys at the table neglected their game to listen they were all big children together and they found the adventures of the family in the tree house so absorbing that they gave them their undivided attention v alexandra and emil spent five days down among the river farms driving up and down the valley alexandra talked to the men about their crops and to the women about their poultry she spent a whole day with one young farmer who had been away at school and who was experimenting with a new kind of clover hay she learned a great deal as they drove along she and emil talked and planned at last on the sixth day alexandra turned brighams head northward and left the river behind theres nothing in it for us down there emil there are a few fine farms but they are owned by the rich men in town and couldnt be bought most of the land is rough and hilly they can always scrape along down there but they can never do anything big down there they have a little certainty but up with us there is a big chance we must have faith in the high land emil i want to hold on harder than ever and when youre a man youll thank me she urged brigham forward when the road began to climb the first long swells of the divide alexandra hummed an old swedish hymn and emil wondered why his sister looked so happy her face was so radiant that he felt shy about asking her for the first time perhaps since that land emerged from the waters of geologic ages a human face was set toward it with love and yearning it seemed beautiful to her rich and strong and glorious her eyes drank in the breadth of it until her tears blinded her then the genius of the divide the great free spirit which breathes across it must have bent lower than it ever bent to a human will before the history of every country begins in the heart of a man or a woman alexandra reached home in the afternoon that evening she held a family council and told her brothers all that she had seen and heard i want you boys to go down yourselves and look it over nothing will convince you like seeing with your own eyes the river land was settled before this and so they are a few years ahead of us and have learned more about farming the land sells for three times as much as this but in five years we will double it the rich men down there own all the best land and they are buying all they can get the thing to do is to sell our cattle and what little old corn we have and buy the linstrum place then the next thing to do is to take out two loans on our halfsections and buy peter crows place raise every dollar we can and buy every acre we can mortgage the homestead again lou cried he sprang up and began to wind the clock furiously i wont slave to pay off another mortgage ill never do it youd just as soon kill us all alexandra to carry out some scheme oscar rubbed his high pale forehead how do you propose to pay off your mortgages alexandra looked from one to the other and bit her lip they had never seen her so nervous see here she brought out at last we borrow the money for six years well with the money we buy a halfsection from linstrum and a half from crow and a quarter from struble maybe that will give us upwards of fourteen hundred acres wont it you wont have to pay off your mortgages for six years by that time any of this land will be worth thirty dollars an acreit will be worth fifty but well say thirty then you can sell a garden patch anywhere and pay off a debt of sixteen hundred dollars its not the principal im worried about its the interest and taxes well have to strain to meet the payments but as sure as we are sitting here tonight we can sit down here ten years from now independent landowners not struggling farmers any longer the chance that father was always looking for has come lou was pacing the floor but how do you know that land is going to go up enough to pay the mortgages and and make us rich besides alexandra put in firmly i cant explain that lou youll have to take my word for it i know thats all when you drive about over the country you can feel it coming oscar had been sitting with his head lowered his hands hanging between his knees but we cant work so much land he said dully as if he were talking to himself we cant even try it would just lie there and wed work ourselves to death he sighed and laid his calloused fist on the table alexandras eyes filled with tears she put her hand on his shoulder you poor boy you wont have to work it the men in town who are buying up other peoples land dont try to farm it they are the men to watch in a new country lets try to do like the shrewd ones and not like these stupid fellows i dont want you boys always to have to work like this i want you to be independent and emil to go to school lou held his head as if it were splitting everybody will say we are crazy it must be crazy or everybody would be doing it if they were we wouldnt have much chance no lou i was talking about that with the smart young man who is raising the new kind of clover he says the right thing is usually just what everybody dont do why are we better fixed than any of our neighbors because father had more brains our people were better people than these in the old country we ought to do more than they do and see further ahead yes mother im going to clear the table now alexandra rose the boys went to the stable to see to the stock and they were gone a long while when they came back lou played on his dragharmonika and oscar sat figuring at his fathers secretary all evening they said nothing more about alexandras project but she felt sure now that they would consent to it just before bedtime oscar went out for a pail of water when he did not come back alexandra threw a shawl over her head and ran down the path to the windmill she found him sitting there with his head in his hands and she sat down beside him dont do anything you dont want to do oscar she whispered she waited a moment but he did not stir i wont say any more about it if youd rather not what makes you so discouraged i dread signing my name to them pieces of paper he said slowly all the time i was a boy we had a mortgage hanging over us then dont sign one i dont want you to if you feel that way oscar shook his head no i can see theres a chance that way ive thought a good while there might be were in so deep now we might as well go deeper but its hard work pulling out of debt like pulling a threshingmachine out of the mud breaks your back me and lous worked hard and i cant see its got us ahead much nobody knows about that as well as i do oscar thats why i want to try an easier way i dont want you to have to grub for every dollar yes i know what you mean maybe itll come out right but signing papers is signing papers there aint no maybe about that he took his pail and trudged up the path to the house alexandra drew her shawl closer about her and stood leaning against the frame of the mill looking at the stars which glittered so keenly through the frosty autumn air she always loved to watch them to think of their vastness and distance and of their ordered march it fortified her to reflect upon the great operations of nature and when she thought of the law that lay behind them she felt a sense of personal security that night she had a new consciousness of the country felt almost a new relation to it even her talk with the boys had not taken away the feeling that had overwhelmed her when she drove back to the divide that afternoon she had never known before how much the country meant to her the chirping of the insects down in the long grass had been like the sweetest music she had felt as if her heart were hiding down there somewhere with the quail and the plover and all the little wild things that crooned or buzzed in the sun under the long shaggy ridges she felt the future stirring part ii neighboring fields i it is sixteen years since john bergson died his wife now lies beside him and the white shaft that marks their graves gleams across the wheatfields could he rise from beneath it he would not know the country under which he has been asleep the shaggy coat of the prairie which they lifted to make him a bed has vanished forever from the norwegian graveyard one looks out over a vast checkerboard marked off in squares of wheat and corn light and dark dark and light telephone wires hum along the white roads which always run at right angles from the graveyard gate one can count a dozen gayly painted farmhouses the gilded weathervanes on the big red barns wink at each other across the green and brown and yellow fields the light steel windmills tremble throughout their frames and tug at their moorings as they vibrate in the wind that often blows from one weeks end to another across that high active resolute stretch of country the divide is now thickly populated the rich soil yields heavy harvests the dry bracing climate and the smoothness of the land make labor easy for men and beasts there are few scenes more gratifying than a spring plowing in that country where the furrows of a single field often lie a mile in length and the brown earth with such a strong clean smell and such a power of growth and fertility in it yields itself eagerly to the plow rolls away from the shear not even dimming the brightness of the metal with a soft deep sigh of happiness the wheatcutting sometimes goes on all night as well as all day and in good seasons there are scarcely men and horses enough to do the harvesting the grain is so heavy that it bends toward the blade and cuts like velvet there is something frank and joyous and young in the open face of the country it gives itself ungrudgingly to the moods of the season holding nothing back like the plains of lombardy it seems to rise a little to meet the sun the air and the earth are curiously mated and intermingled as if the one were the breath of the other you feel in the atmosphere the same tonic puissant quality that is in the tilth the same strength and resoluteness one june morning a young man stood at the gate of the norwegian graveyard sharpening his scythe in strokes unconsciously timed to the tune he was whistling he wore a flannel cap and duck trousers and the sleeves of his white flannel shirt were rolled back to the elbow when he was satisfied with the edge of his blade he slipped the whetstone into his hip pocket and began to swing his scythe still whistling but softly out of respect to the quiet folk about him unconscious respect probably for he seemed intent upon his own thoughts and like the gladiators they were far away he was a splendid figure of a boy tall and straight as a young pine tree with a handsome head and stormy gray eyes deeply set under a serious brow the space between his two front teeth which were unusually far apart gave him the proficiency in whistling for which he was distinguished at college he also played the cornet in the university band when the grass required his close attention or when he had to stoop to cut about a headstone he paused in his lively airthe jewel songtaking it up where he had left it when his scythe swung free again he was not thinking about the tired pioneers over whom his blade glittered the old wild country the struggle in which his sister was destined to succeed while so many men broke their hearts and died he can scarcely remember that is all among the dim things of childhood and has been forgotten in the brighter pattern life weaves today in the bright facts of being captain of the track team and holding the interstate record for the high jump in the allsuffusing brightness of being twentyone yet sometimes in the pauses of his work the young man frowned and looked at the ground with an intentness which suggested that even twentyone might have its problems when he had been mowing the better part of an hour he heard the rattle of a light cart on the road behind him supposing that it was his sister coming back from one of her farms he kept on with his work the cart stopped at the gate and a merry contralto voice called almost through emil he dropped his scythe and went toward the fence wiping his face and neck with his handkerchief in the cart sat a young woman who wore driving gauntlets and a wide shade hat trimmed with red poppies her face too was rather like a poppy round and brown with rich color in her cheeks and lips and her dancing yellowbrown eyes bubbled with gayety the wind was flapping her big hat and teasing a curl of her chestnutcolored hair she shook her head at the tall youth what time did you get over here thats not much of a job for an athlete here ive been to town and back alexandra lets you sleep late oh i know lous wife was telling me about the way she spoils you i was going to give you a lift if you were done she gathered up her reins but i will be in a minute please wait for me marie emil coaxed alexandra sent me to mow our lot but ive done half a dozen others you see just wait till i finish off the kourdnas by the way they were bohemians why arent they up in the catholic graveyard freethinkers replied the young woman laconically lots of the bohemian boys at the university are said emil taking up his scythe again what did you ever burn john huss for anyway its made an awful row they still jaw about it in history classes wed do it right over again most of us said the young woman hotly dont they ever teach you in your history classes that youd all be heathen turks if it hadnt been for the bohemians emil had fallen to mowing oh theres no denying youre a spunky little bunch you czechs he called back over his shoulder marie shabata settled herself in her seat and watched the rhythmical movement of the young mans long arms swinging her foot as if in time to some air that was going through her mind the minutes passed emil mowed vigorously and marie sat sunning herself and watching the long grass fall she sat with the ease that belongs to persons of an essentially happy nature who can find a comfortable spot almost anywhere who are supple and quick in adapting themselves to circumstances after a final swish emil snapped the gate and sprang into the cart holding his scythe well out over the wheel there he sighed i gave old man lee a cut or so too lous wife neednt talk i never see lous scythe over here marie clucked to her horse oh you know annie she looked at the young mans bare arms how brown youve got since you came home i wish i had an athlete to mow my orchard i get wet to my knees when i go down to pick cherries you can have one any time you want him better wait until after it rains emil squinted off at the horizon as if he were looking for clouds will you oh theres a good boy she turned her head to him with a quick bright smile he felt it rather than saw it indeed he had looked away with the purpose of not seeing it ive been up looking at angeliques wedding clothes marie went on and im so excited i can hardly wait until sunday amedee will be a handsome bridegroom is anybody but you going to stand up with him well then it will be a handsome wedding party she made a droll face at emil who flushed frank marie continued flicking her horse is cranky at me because i loaned his saddle to jan smirka and im terribly afraid he wont take me to the dance in the evening maybe the supper will tempt him all angeliques folks are baking for it and all amedees twenty cousins there will be barrels of beer if once i get frank to the supper ill see that i stay for the dance and by the way emil you mustnt dance with me but once or twice you must dance with all the french girls it hurts their feelings if you dont they think youre proud because youve been away to school or something emil sniffed how do you know they think that well you didnt dance with them much at raoul marcels party and i could tell how they took it by the way they looked at youand at me all right said emil shortly studying the glittering blade of his scythe they drove westward toward norway creek and toward a big white house that stood on a hill several miles across the fields there were so many sheds and outbuildings grouped about it that the place looked not unlike a tiny village a stranger approaching it could not help noticing the beauty and fruitfulness of the outlying fields there was something individual about the great farm a most unusual trimness and care for detail on either side of the road for a mile before you reached the foot of the hill stood tall osage orange hedges their glossy green marking off the yellow fields south of the hill in a low sheltered swale surrounded by a mulberry hedge was the orchard its fruit trees kneedeep in timothy grass any one thereabouts would have told you that this was one of the richest farms on the divide and that the farmer was a woman alexandra bergson if you go up the hill and enter alexandras big house you will find that it is curiously unfinished and uneven in comfort one room is papered carpeted overfurnished the next is almost bare the pleasantest rooms in the house are the kitchenwhere alexandras three young swedish girls chatter and cook and pickle and preserve all summer longand the sittingroom in which alexandra has brought together the old homely furniture that the bergsons used in their first log house the family portraits and the few things her mother brought from sweden when you go out of the house into the flower garden there you feel again the order and fine arrangement manifest all over the great farm in the fencing and hedging in the windbreaks and sheds in the symmetrical pasture ponds planted with scrub willows to give shade to the cattle in flytime there is even a white row of beehives in the orchard under the walnut trees you feel that properly alexandras house is the big outofdoors and that it is in the soil that she expresses herself best ii emil reached home a little past noon and when he went into the kitchen alexandra was already seated at the head of the long table having dinner with her men as she always did unless there were visitors he slipped into his empty place at his sisters right the three pretty young swedish girls who did alexandras housework were cutting pies refilling coffeecups placing platters of bread and meat and potatoes upon the red tablecloth and continually getting in each others way between the table and the stove to be sure they always wasted a good deal of time getting in each others way and giggling at each others mistakes but as alexandra had pointedly told her sistersinlaw it was to hear them giggle that she kept three young things in her kitchen the work she could do herself if it were necessary these girls with their long letters from home their finery and their loveaffairs afforded her a great deal of entertainment and they were company for her when emil was away at school of the youngest girl signa who has a pretty figure mottled pink cheeks and yellow hair alexandra is very fond though she keeps a sharp eye upon her signa is apt to be skittish at mealtime when the men are about and to spill the coffee or upset the cream it is supposed that nelse jensen one of the six men at the dinnertable is courting signa though he has been so careful not to commit himself that no one in the house least of all signa can tell just how far the matter has progressed nelse watches her glumly as she waits upon the table and in the evening he sits on a bench behind the stove with his dragharmonika playing mournful airs and watching her as she goes about her work when alexandra asked signa whether she thought nelse was in earnest the poor child hid her hands under her apron and murmured i dont know mam but he scolds me about everything like as if he wanted to have me at alexandras left sat a very old man barefoot and wearing a long blue blouse open at the neck his shaggy head is scarcely whiter than it was sixteen years ago but his little blue eyes have become pale and watery and his ruddy face is withered like an apple that has clung all winter to the tree when ivar lost his land through mismanagement a dozen years ago alexandra took him in and he has been a member of her household ever since he is too old to work in the fields but he hitches and unhitches the workteams and looks after the health of the stock sometimes of a winter evening alexandra calls him into the sittingroom to read the bible aloud to her for he still reads very well he dislikes human habitations so alexandra has fitted him up a room in the barn where he is very comfortable being near the horses and as he says further from temptations no one has ever found out what his temptations are in cold weather he sits by the kitchen fire and makes hammocks or mends harness until it is time to go to bed then he says his prayers at great length behind the stove puts on his buffaloskin coat and goes out to his room in the barn alexandra herself has changed very little her figure is fuller and she has more color she seems sunnier and more vigorous than she did as a young girl but she still has the same calmness and deliberation of manner the same clear eyes and she still wears her hair in two braids wound round her head it is so curly that fiery ends escape from the braids and make her head look like one of the big double sunflowers that fringe her vegetable garden her face is always tanned in summer for her sunbonnet is oftener on her arm than on her head but where her collar falls away from her neck or where her sleeves are pushed back from her wrist the skin is of such smoothness and whiteness as none but swedish women ever possess skin with the freshness of the snow itself alexandra did not talk much at the table but she encouraged her men to talk and she always listened attentively even when they seemed to be talking foolishly today barney flinn the big redheaded irishman who had been with alexandra for five years and who was actually her foreman though he had no such title was grumbling about the new silo she had put up that spring it happened to be the first silo on the divide and alexandras neighbors and her men were skeptical about it to be sure if the thing dont work well have plenty of feed without it indeed barney conceded nelse jensen signas gloomy suitor had his word lou he says he wouldnt have no silo on his place if youd give it to him he says the feed outen it gives the stock the bloat he heard of somebody lost four head of horses feedin em that stuff alexandra looked down the table from one to another well the only way we can find out is to try lou and i have different notions about feeding stock and thats a good thing its bad if all the members of a family think alike they never get anywhere lou can learn by my mistakes and i can learn by his isnt that fair barney the irishman laughed he had no love for lou who was always uppish with him and who said that alexandra paid her hands too much ive no thought but to give the thing an honest try mum t would be only right after puttin so much expense into it maybe emil will come out an have a look at it wid me he pushed back his chair took his hat from the nail and marched out with emil who with his university ideas was supposed to have instigated the silo the other hands followed them all except old ivar he had been depressed throughout the meal and had paid no heed to the talk of the men even when they mentioned cornstalk bloat upon which he was sure to have opinions did you want to speak to me ivar alexandra asked as she rose from the table come into the sittingroom the old man followed alexandra but when she motioned him to a chair he shook his head she took up her workbasket and waited for him to speak he stood looking at the carpet his bushy head bowed his hands clasped in front of him ivars bandy legs seemed to have grown shorter with years and they were completely misfitted to his broad thick body and heavy shoulders well ivar what is it alexandra asked after she had waited longer than usual ivar had never learned to speak english and his norwegian was quaint and grave like the speech of the more oldfashioned people he always addressed alexandra in terms of the deepest respect hoping to set a good example to the kitchen girls whom he thought too familiar in their manners mistress he began faintly without raising his eyes the folk have been looking coldly at me of late you know there has been talk talk about what ivar about sending me away to the asylum alexandra put down her sewingbasket nobody has come to me with such talk she said decidedly why need you listen you know i would never consent to such a thing ivar lifted his shaggy head and looked at her out of his little eyes they say that you cannot prevent it if the folk complain of me if your brothers complain to the authorities they say that your brothers are afraidgod forbidthat i may do you some injury when my spells are on me mistress how can any one think thatthat i could bite the hand that fed me the tears trickled down on the old mans beard alexandra frowned ivar i wonder at you that you should come bothering me with such nonsense i am still running my own house and other people have nothing to do with either you or me so long as i am suited with you there is nothing to be said ivar pulled a red handkerchief out of the breast of his blouse and wiped his eyes and beard but i should not wish you to keep me if as they say it is against your interests and if it is hard for you to get hands because i am here alexandra made an impatient gesture but the old man put out his hand and went on earnestly listen mistress it is right that you should take these things into account you know that my spells come from god and that i would not harm any living creature you believe that every one should worship god in the way revealed to him but that is not the way of this country the way here is for all to do alike i am despised because i do not wear shoes because i do not cut my hair and because i have visions at home in the old country there were many like me who had been touched by god or who had seen things in the graveyard at night and were different afterward we thought nothing of it and let them alone but here if a man is different in his feet or in his head they put him in the asylum look at peter kralik when he was a boy drinking out of a creek he swallowed a snake and always after that he could eat only such food as the creature liked for when he ate anything else it became enraged and gnawed him when he felt it whipping about in him he drank alcohol to stupefy it and get some ease for himself he could work as good as any man and his head was clear but they locked him up for being different in his stomach that is the way they have built the asylum for people who are different and they will not even let us live in the holes with the badgers only your great prosperity has protected me so far if you had had illfortune they would have taken me to hastings long ago as ivar talked his gloom lifted alexandra had found that she could often break his fasts and long penances by talking to him and letting him pour out the thoughts that troubled him sympathy always cleared his mind and ridicule was poison to him there is a great deal in what you say ivar like as not they will be wanting to take me to hastings because i have built a silo and then i may take you with me but at present i need you here only dont come to me again telling me what people say let people go on talking as they like and we will go on living as we think best you have been with me now for twelve years and i have gone to you for advice oftener than i have ever gone to any one that ought to satisfy you ivar bowed humbly yes mistress i shall not trouble you with their talk again and as for my feet i have observed your wishes all these years though you have never questioned me washing them every night even in winter alexandra laughed oh never mind about your feet ivar we can remember when half our neighbors went barefoot in summer i expect old mrs lee would love to slip her shoes off now sometimes if she dared im glad im not lous motherinlaw ivar looked about mysteriously and lowered his voice almost to a whisper you know what they have over at lous house a great white tub like the stone watertroughs in the old country to wash themselves in when you sent me over with the strawberries they were all in town but the old woman lee and the baby she took me in and showed me the thing and she told me it was impossible to wash yourself clean in it because in so much water you could not make a strong suds so when they fill it up and send her in there she pretends and makes a splashing noise then when they are all asleep she washes herself in a little wooden tub she keeps under her bed alexandra shook with laughter poor old mrs lee they wont let her wear nightcaps either never mind when she comes to visit me she can do all the old things in the old way and have as much beer as she wants well start an asylum for oldtime people ivar ivar folded his big handkerchief carefully and thrust it back into his blouse this is always the way mistress i come to you sorrowing and you send me away with a light heart and will you be so good as to tell the irishman that he is not to work the brown gelding until the sore on its shoulder is healed that i will now go and put emils mare to the cart i am going to drive up to the north quarter to meet the man from town who is to buy my alfalfa hay iii alexandra was to hear more of ivars case however on sunday her married brothers came to dinner she had asked them for that day because emil who hated family parties would be absent dancing at amedee chevaliers wedding up in the french country the table was set for company in the diningroom where highly varnished wood and colored glass and useless pieces of china were conspicuous enough to satisfy the standards of the new prosperity alexandra had put herself into the hands of the hanover furniture dealer and he had conscientiously done his best to make her diningroom look like his display window she said frankly that she knew nothing about such things and she was willing to be governed by the general conviction that the more useless and utterly unusable objects were the greater their virtue as ornament that seemed reasonable enough since she liked plain things herself it was all the more necessary to have jars and punchbowls and candlesticks in the company rooms for people who did appreciate them her guests liked to see about them these reassuring emblems of prosperity the family party was complete except for emil and oscars wife who in the country phrase was not going anywhere just now oscar sat at the foot of the table and his four towheaded little boys aged from twelve to five were ranged at one side neither oscar nor lou has changed much they have simply as alexandra said of them long ago grown to be more and more like themselves lou now looks the older of the two his face is thin and shrewd and wrinkled about the eyes while oscars is thick and dull for all his dullness however oscar makes more money than his brother which adds to lous sharpness and uneasiness and tempts him to make a show the trouble with lou is that he is tricky and his neighbors have found out that as ivar says he has not a foxs face for nothing politics being the natural field for such talents he neglects his farm to attend conventions and to run for county offices lous wife formerly annie lee has grown to look curiously like her husband her face has become longer sharper more aggressive she wears her yellow hair in a high pompadour and is bedecked with rings and chains and beauty pins her tight highheeled shoes give her an awkward walk and she is always more or less preoccupied with her clothes as she sat at the table she kept telling her youngest daughter to be careful now and not drop anything on mother the conversation at the table was all in english oscars wife from the malaria district of missouri was ashamed of marrying a foreigner and his boys do not understand a word of swedish annie and lou sometimes speak swedish at home but annie is almost as much afraid of being caught at it as ever her mother was of being caught barefoot oscar still has a thick accent but lou speaks like anybody from iowa when i was in hastings to attend the convention he was saying i saw the superintendent of the asylum and i was telling him about ivars symptoms he says ivars case is one of the most dangerous kind and its a wonder he hasnt done something violent before this alexandra laughed goodhumoredly oh nonsense lou the doctors would have us all crazy if they could ivars queer certainly but he has more sense than half the hands i hire lou flew at his fried chicken oh i guess the doctor knows his business alexandra he was very much surprised when i told him how youd put up with ivar he says hes likely to set fire to the barn any night or to take after you and the girls with an axe little signa who was waiting on the table giggled and fled to the kitchen alexandras eyes twinkled that was too much for signa lou we all know that ivars perfectly harmless the girls would as soon expect me to chase them with an axe lou flushed and signaled to his wife all the same the neighbors will be having a say about it before long he may burn anybodys barn its only necessary for one propertyowner in the township to make complaint and hell be taken up by force youd better send him yourself and not have any hard feelings alexandra helped one of her little nephews to gravy well lou if any of the neighbors try that ill have myself appointed ivars guardian and take the case to court thats all i am perfectly satisfied with him pass the preserves lou said annie in a warning tone she had reasons for not wishing her husband to cross alexandra too openly but dont you sort of hate to have people see him around here alexandra she went on with persuasive smoothness he is a disgraceful object and youre fixed up so nice now it sort of makes people distant with you when they never know when theyll hear him scratching about my girls are afraid as death of him arent you milly dear milly was fifteen fat and jolly and pompadoured with a creamy complexion square white teeth and a short upper lip she looked like her grandmother bergson and had her comfortable and comfortloving nature she grinned at her aunt with whom she was a great deal more at ease than she was with her mother alexandra winked a reply milly neednt be afraid of ivar shes an especial favorite of his in my opinion ivar has just as much right to his own way of dressing and thinking as we have but ill see that he doesnt bother other people ill keep him at home so dont trouble any more about him lou ive been wanting to ask you about your new bathtub how does it work annie came to the fore to give lou time to recover himself oh it works something grand i cant keep him out of it he washes himself all over three times a week now and uses all the hot water i think its weakening to stay in as long as he does you ought to have one alexandra im thinking of it i might have one put in the barn for ivar if it will ease peoples minds but before i get a bathtub im going to get a piano for milly oscar at the end of the table looked up from his plate what does milly want of a pianny whats the matter with her organ she can make some use of that and play in church annie looked flustered she had begged alexandra not to say anything about this plan before oscar who was apt to be jealous of what his sister did for lous children alexandra did not get on with oscars wife at all milly can play in church just the same and shell still play on the organ but practising on it so much spoils her touch her teacher says so annie brought out with spirit oscar rolled his eyes well milly must have got on pretty good if shes got past the organ i know plenty of grown folks that aint he said bluntly annie threw up her chin she has got on good and shes going to play for her commencement when she graduates in town next year yes said alexandra firmly i think milly deserves a piano all the girls around here have been taking lessons for years but milly is the only one of them who can ever play anything when you ask her ill tell you when i first thought i would like to give you a piano milly and that was when you learned that book of old swedish songs that your grandfather used to sing he had a sweet tenor voice and when he was a young man he loved to sing i can remember hearing him singing with the sailors down in the shipyard when i was no bigger than stella here pointing to annies younger daughter milly and stella both looked through the door into the sittingroom where a crayon portrait of john bergson hung on the wall alexandra had had it made from a little photograph taken for his friends just before he left sweden a slender man of thirtyfive with soft hair curling about his high forehead a drooping mustache and wondering sad eyes that looked forward into the distance as if they already beheld the new world after dinner lou and oscar went to the orchard to pick cherriesthey had neither of them had the patience to grow an orchard of their ownand annie went down to gossip with alexandras kitchen girls while they washed the dishes she could always find out more about alexandras domestic economy from the prattling maids than from alexandra herself and what she discovered she used to her own advantage with lou on the divide farmers daughters no longer went out into service so alexandra got her girls from sweden by paying their fare over they stayed with her until they married and were replaced by sisters or cousins from the old country alexandra took her three nieces into the flower garden she was fond of the little girls especially of milly who came to spend a week with her aunt now and then and read aloud to her from the old books about the house or listened to stories about the early days on the divide while they were walking among the flower beds a buggy drove up the hill and stopped in front of the gate a man got out and stood talking to the driver the little girls were delighted at the advent of a stranger some one from very far away they knew by his clothes his gloves and the sharp pointed cut of his dark beard the girls fell behind their aunt and peeped out at him from among the castor beans the stranger came up to the gate and stood holding his hat in his hand smiling while alexandra advanced slowly to meet him as she approached he spoke in a low pleasant voice dont you know me alexandra i would have known you anywhere alexandra shaded her eyes with her hand suddenly she took a quick step forward can it be she exclaimed with feeling can it be that it is carl linstrum why carl it is she threw out both her hands and caught his across the gate sadie milly run tell your father and uncle oscar that our old friend carl linstrum is here be quick why carl how did it happen i cant believe this alexandra shook the tears from her eyes and laughed the stranger nodded to his driver dropped his suitcase inside the fence and opened the gate then you are glad to see me and you can put me up overnight i couldnt go through this country without stopping off to have a look at you how little you have changed do you know i was sure it would be like that you simply couldnt be different how fine you are he stepped back and looked at her admiringly alexandra blushed and laughed again but you yourself carlwith that beardhow could i have known you you went away a little boy she reached for his suitcase and when he intercepted her she threw up her hands you see i give myself away i have only women come to visit me and i do not know how to behave where is your trunk its in hanover i can stay only a few days i am on my way to the coast they started up the path a few days after all these years alexandra shook her finger at him see this you have walked into a trap you do not get away so easy she put her hand affectionately on his shoulder you owe me a visit for the sake of old times why must you go to the coast at all oh i must i am a fortune hunter from seattle i go on to alaska alaska she looked at him in astonishment are you going to paint the indians paint the young man frowned oh im not a painter alexandra im an engraver i have nothing to do with painting but on my parlor wall i have the paintings he interrupted nervously oh watercolor sketchesdone for amusement i sent them to remind you of me not because they were good what a wonderful place you have made of this alexandra he turned and looked back at the wide maplike prospect of field and hedge and pasture i would never have believed it could be done im disappointed in my own eye in my imagination at this moment lou and oscar came up the hill from the orchard they did not quicken their pace when they saw carl indeed they did not openly look in his direction they advanced distrustfully and as if they wished the distance were longer alexandra beckoned to them they think i am trying to fool them come boys its carl linstrum our old carl lou gave the visitor a quick sidelong glance and thrust out his hand glad to see you oscar followed with how d do carl could not tell whether their offishness came from unfriendliness or from embarrassment he and alexandra led the way to the porch carl alexandra explained is on his way to seattle he is going to alaska oscar studied the visitors yellow shoes got business there he asked carl laughed yes very pressing business im going there to get rich engravings a very interesting profession but a man never makes any money at it so im going to try the goldfields alexandra felt that this was a tactful speech and lou looked up with some interest ever done anything in that line before no but im going to join a friend of mine who went out from new york and has done well he has offered to break me in turrible cold winters there i hear remarked oscar i thought people went up there in the spring they do but my friend is going to spend the winter in seattle and i am to stay with him there and learn something about prospecting before we start north next year lou looked skeptical lets see how long have you been away from here sixteen years you ought to remember that lou for you were married just after we went away going to stay with us some time oscar asked a few days if alexandra can keep me i expect youll be wanting to see your old place lou observed more cordially you wont hardly know it but theres a few chunks of your old sod house left alexandra wouldnt never let frank shabata plough over it annie lee who ever since the visitor was announced had been touching up her hair and settling her lace and wishing she had worn another dress now emerged with her three daughters and introduced them she was greatly impressed by carls urban appearance and in her excitement talked very loud and threw her head about and you aint married yet at your age now think of that youll have to wait for milly yes weve got a boy too the youngest hes at home with his grandma you must come over to see mother and hear milly play shes the musician of the family she does pyrography too thats burnt wood you know you wouldnt believe what she can do with her poker yes she goes to school in town and she is the youngest in her class by two years milly looked uncomfortable and carl took her hand again he liked her creamy skin and happy innocent eyes and he could see that her mothers way of talking distressed her im sure shes a clever little girl he murmured looking at her thoughtfully let me seeah its your mother that she looks like alexandra mrs bergson must have looked just like this when she was a little girl does milly run about over the country as you and alexandra used to annie millys mother protested oh my no things has changed since we was girls milly has it very different we are going to rent the place and move into town as soon as the girls are old enough to go out into company a good many are doing that here now lou is going into business lou grinned thats what she says you better go get your things on ivars hitching up he added turning to annie young farmers seldom address their wives by name it is always you or she having got his wife out of the way lou sat down on the step and began to whittle well what do folks in new york think of william jennings bryan lou began to bluster as he always did when he talked politics we gave wall street a scare in ninetysix all right and were fixing another to hand them silver wasnt the only issue he nodded mysteriously theres a good many things got to be changed the west is going to make itself heard carl laughed but surely it did do that if nothing else lous thin face reddened up to the roots of his bristly hair oh weve only begun were waking up to a sense of our responsibilities out here and we aint afraid neither you fellows back there must be a tame lot if you had any nerve youd get together and march down to wall street and blow it up dynamite it i mean with a threatening nod he was so much in earnest that carl scarcely knew how to answer him that would be a waste of powder the same business would go on in another street the street doesnt matter but what have you fellows out here got to kick about you have the only safe place there is morgan himself couldnt touch you one only has to drive through this country to see that youre all as rich as barons we have a good deal more to say than we had when we were poor said lou threateningly were getting on to a whole lot of things as ivar drove a double carriage up to the gate annie came out in a hat that looked like the model of a battleship carl rose and took her down to the carriage while lou lingered for a word with his sister what do you suppose hes come for he asked jerking his head toward the gate why to pay us a visit ive been begging him to for years oscar looked at alexandra he didnt let you know he was coming no why should he i told him to come at any time lou shrugged his shoulders he doesnt seem to have done much for himself wandering around this way oscar spoke solemnly as from the depths of a cavern he never was much account alexandra left them and hurried down to the gate where annie was rattling on to carl about her new diningroom furniture you must bring mr linstrum over real soon only be sure to telephone me first she called back as carl helped her into the carriage old ivar his white head bare stood holding the horses lou came down the path and climbed into the front seat took up the reins and drove off without saying anything further to any one oscar picked up his youngest boy and trudged off down the road the other three trotting after him carl holding the gate open for alexandra began to laugh up and coming on the divide eh alexandra he cried gayly iv carl had changed alexandra felt much less than one might have expected he had not become a trim selfsatisfied city man there was still something homely and wayward and definitely personal about him even his clothes his norfolk coat and his very high collars were a little unconventional he seemed to shrink into himself as he used to do to hold himself away from things as if he were afraid of being hurt in short he was more selfconscious than a man of thirtyfive is expected to be he looked older than his years and not very strong his black hair which still hung in a triangle over his pale forehead was thin at the crown and there were fine relentless lines about his eyes his back with its high sharp shoulders looked like the back of an overworked german professor off on his holiday his face was intelligent sensitive unhappy that evening after supper carl and alexandra were sitting by the clump of castor beans in the middle of the flower garden the gravel paths glittered in the moonlight and below them the fields lay white and still do you know alexandra he was saying ive been thinking how strangely things work out ive been away engraving other mens pictures and youve stayed at home and made your own he pointed with his cigar toward the sleeping landscape how in the world have you done it how have your neighbors done it we hadnt any of us much to do with it carl the land did it it had its little joke it pretended to be poor because nobody knew how to work it right and then all at once it worked itself it woke up out of its sleep and stretched itself and it was so big so rich that we suddenly found we were rich just from sitting still as for me you remember when i began to buy land for years after that i was always squeezing and borrowing until i was ashamed to show my face in the banks and then all at once men began to come to me offering to lend me moneyand i didnt need it then i went ahead and built this house i really built it for emil i want you to see emil carl he is so different from the rest of us how different oh youll see im sure it was to have sons like emil and to give them a chance that father left the old country its curious too on the outside emil is just like an american boyhe graduated from the state university in june you knowbut underneath he is more swedish than any of us sometimes he is so like father that he frightens me he is so violent in his feelings like that is he going to farm here with you he shall do whatever he wants to alexandra declared warmly he is going to have a chance a whole chance thats what ive worked for sometimes he talks about studying law and sometimes just lately hes been talking about going out into the sand hills and taking up more land he has his sad times like father but i hope he wont do that we have land enough at last alexandra laughed how about lou and oscar theyve done well havent they yes very well but they are different and now that they have farms of their own i do not see so much of them we divided the land equally when lou married they have their own way of doing things and they do not altogether like my way i am afraid perhaps they think me too independent but i have had to think for myself a good many years and am not likely to change on the whole though we take as much comfort in each other as most brothers and sisters do and i am very fond of lous oldest daughter i think i liked the old lou and oscar better and they probably feel the same about me i even if you can keep a secretcarl leaned forward and touched her arm smilingi even think i liked the old country better this is all very splendid in its way but there was something about this country when it was a wild old beast that has haunted me all these years now when i come back to all this milk and honey i feel like the old german song wo bist du wo bist du mein geliebtest landdo you ever feel like that i wonder yes sometimes when i think about father and mother and those who are gone so many of our old neighbors alexandra paused and looked up thoughtfully at the stars we can remember the graveyard when it was wild prairie carl and now and now the old story has begun to write itself over there said carl softly isnt it queer there are only two or three human stories and they go on repeating themselves as fiercely as if they had never happened before like the larks in this country that have been singing the same five notes over for thousands of years oh yes the young people they live so hard and yet i sometimes envy them there is my little neighbor now the people who bought your old place i wouldnt have sold it to any one else but i was always fond of that girl you must remember her little marie tovesky from omaha who used to visit here when she was eighteen she ran away from the convent school and got married crazy child she came out here a bride with her father and husband he had nothing and the old man was willing to buy them a place and set them up your farm took her fancy and i was glad to have her so near me ive never been sorry either i even try to get along with frank on her account is frank her husband yes hes one of these wild fellows most bohemians are goodnatured but frank thinks we dont appreciate him here i guess hes jealous about everything his farm and his horses and his pretty wife everybody likes her just the same as when she was little sometimes i go up to the catholic church with emil and its funny to see marie standing there laughing and shaking hands with people looking so excited and gay with frank sulking behind her as if he could eat everybody alive franks not a bad neighbor but to get on with him youve got to make a fuss over him and act as if you thought he was a very important person all the time and different from other people i find it hard to keep that up from one years end to another i shouldnt think youd be very successful at that kind of thing alexandra carl seemed to find the idea amusing well said alexandra firmly i do the best i can on maries account she has it hard enough anyway shes too young and pretty for this sort of life were all ever so much older and slower but shes the kind that wont be downed easily shell work all day and go to a bohemian wedding and dance all night and drive the hay wagon for a cross man next morning i could stay by a job but i never had the go in me that she has when i was going my best ill have to take you over to see her tomorrow carl dropped the end of his cigar softly among the castor beans and sighed yes i suppose i must see the old place im cowardly about things that remind me of myself it took courage to come at all alexandra i wouldnt have if i hadnt wanted to see you very very much alexandra looked at him with her calm deliberate eyes why do you dread things like that carl she asked earnestly why are you dissatisfied with yourself her visitor winced how direct you are alexandra just like you used to be do i give myself away so quickly well you see for one thing theres nothing to look forward to in my profession woodengraving is the only thing i care about and that had gone out before i began everythings cheap metal work nowadays touching up miserable photographs forcing up poor drawings and spoiling good ones im absolutely sick of it all carl frowned alexandra all the way out from new york ive been planning how i could deceive you and make you think me a very enviable fellow and here i am telling you the truth the first night i waste a lot of time pretending to people and the joke of it is i dont think i ever deceive any one there are too many of my kind people know us on sight carl paused alexandra pushed her hair back from her brow with a puzzled thoughtful gesture you see he went on calmly measured by your standards here im a failure i couldnt buy even one of your cornfields ive enjoyed a great many things but ive got nothing to show for it all but you show for it yourself carl id rather have had your freedom than my land carl shook his head mournfully freedom so often means that one isnt needed anywhere here you are an individual you have a background of your own you would be missed but off there in the cities there are thousands of rolling stones like me we are all alike we have no ties we know nobody we own nothing when one of us dies they scarcely know where to bury him our landlady and the delicatessen man are our mourners and we leave nothing behind us but a frockcoat and a fiddle or an easel or a typewriter or whatever tool we got our living by all we have ever managed to do is to pay our rent the exorbitant rent that one has to pay for a few square feet of space near the heart of things we have no house no place no people of our own we live in the streets in the parks in the theatres we sit in restaurants and concert halls and look about at the hundreds of our own kind and shudder alexandra was silent she sat looking at the silver spot the moon made on the surface of the pond down in the pasture he knew that she understood what he meant at last she said slowly and yet i would rather have emil grow up like that than like his two brothers we pay a high rent too though we pay differently we grow hard and heavy here we dont move lightly and easily as you do and our minds get stiff if the world were no wider than my cornfields if there were not something beside this i wouldnt feel that it was much worth while to work no i would rather have emil like you than like them i felt that as soon as you came i wonder why you feel like that carl mused i dont know perhaps i am like carrie jensen the sister of one of my hired men she had never been out of the cornfields and a few years ago she got despondent and said life was just the same thing over and over and she didnt see the use of it after she had tried to kill herself once or twice her folks got worried and sent her over to iowa to visit some relations ever since shes come back shes been perfectly cheerful and she says shes contented to live and work in a world thats so big and interesting she said that anything as big as the bridges over the platte and the missouri reconciled her and its what goes on in the world that reconciles me v alexandra did not find time to go to her neighbors the next day nor the next it was a busy season on the farm with the cornplowing going on and even emil was in the field with a team and cultivator carl went about over the farms with alexandra in the morning and in the afternoon and evening they found a great deal to talk about emil for all his track practice did not stand up under farmwork very well and by night he was too tired to talk or even to practise on his cornet on wednesday morning carl got up before it was light and stole downstairs and out of the kitchen door just as old ivar was making his morning ablutions at the pump carl nodded to him and hurried up the draw past the garden and into the pasture where the milking cows used to be kept the dawn in the east looked like the light from some great fire that was burning under the edge of the world the color was reflected in the globules of dew that sheathed the short gray pasture grass carl walked rapidly until he came to the crest of the second hill where the bergson pasture joined the one that had belonged to his father there he sat down and waited for the sun to rise it was just there that he and alexandra used to do their milking together he on his side of the fence she on hers he could remember exactly how she looked when she came over the closecropped grass her skirts pinned up her head bare a bright tin pail in either hand and the milky light of the early morning all about her even as a boy he used to feel when he saw her coming with her free step her upright head and calm shoulders that she looked as if she had walked straight out of the morning itself since then when he had happened to see the sun come up in the country or on the water he had often remembered the young swedish girl and her milking pails carl sat musing until the sun leaped above the prairie and in the grass about him all the small creatures of day began to tune their tiny instruments birds and insects without number began to chirp to twitter to snap and whistle to make all manner of fresh shrill noises the pasture was flooded with light every clump of ironweed and snowonthemountain threw a long shadow and the golden light seemed to be rippling through the curly grass like the tide racing in he crossed the fence into the pasture that was now the shabatas and continued his walk toward the pond he had not gone far however when he discovered that he was not the only person abroad in the draw below his gun in his hands was emil advancing cautiously with a young woman beside him they were moving softly keeping close together and carl knew that they expected to find ducks on the pond at the moment when they came in sight of the bright spot of water he heard a whirr of wings and the ducks shot up into the air there was a sharp crack from the gun and five of the birds fell to the ground emil and his companion laughed delightedly and emil ran to pick them up when he came back dangling the ducks by their feet marie held her apron and he dropped them into it as she stood looking down at them her face changed she took up one of the birds a rumpled ball of feathers with the blood dripping slowly from its mouth and looked at the live color that still burned on its plumage as she let it fall she cried in distress oh emil why did you i like that the boy exclaimed indignantly why marie you asked me to come yourself yes yes i know she said tearfully but i didnt think i hate to see them when they are first shot they were having such a good time and weve spoiled it all for them emil gave a rather sore laugh i should say we had im not going hunting with you any more youre as bad as ivar here let me take them he snatched the ducks out of her apron dont be cross emil onlyivars right about wild things theyre too happy to kill you can tell just how they felt when they flew up they were scared but they didnt really think anything could hurt them no we wont do that any more all right emil assented im sorry i made you feel bad as he looked down into her tearful eyes there was a curious sharp young bitterness in his own carl watched them as they moved slowly down the draw they had not seen him at all he had not overheard much of their dialogue but he felt the import of it it made him somehow unreasonably mournful to find two young things abroad in the pasture in the early morning he decided that he needed his breakfast vi at dinner that day alexandra said she thought they must really manage to go over to the shabatas that afternoon its not often i let three days go by without seeing marie she will think i have forsaken her now that my old friend has come back after the men had gone back to work alexandra put on a white dress and her sunhat and she and carl set forth across the fields you see we have kept up the old path carl it has been so nice for me to feel that there was a friend at the other end of it again carl smiled a little ruefully all the same i hope it hasnt been quite the same alexandra looked at him with surprise why no of course not not the same she could not very well take your place if thats what you mean im friendly with all my neighbors i hope but marie is really a companion some one i can talk to quite frankly you wouldnt want me to be more lonely than i have been would you carl laughed and pushed back the triangular lock of hair with the edge of his hat of course i dont i ought to be thankful that this path hasnt been worn bywell by friends with more pressing errands than your little bohemian is likely to have he paused to give alexandra his hand as she stepped over the stile are you the least bit disappointed in our coming together again he asked abruptly is it the way you hoped it would be alexandra smiled at this only better when ive thought about your coming ive sometimes been a little afraid of it you have lived where things move so fast and everything is slow here the people slowest of all our lives are like the years all made up of weather and crops and cows how you hated cows she shook her head and laughed to herself i didnt when we milked together i walked up to the pasture corners this morning i wonder whether i shall ever be able to tell you all that i was thinking about up there its a strange thing alexandra i find it easy to be frank with you about everything under the sun exceptyourself you are afraid of hurting my feelings perhaps alexandra looked at him thoughtfully no im afraid of giving you a shock youve seen yourself for so long in the dull minds of the people about you that if i were to tell you how you seem to me it would startle you but you must see that you astonish me you must feel when people admire you alexandra blushed and laughed with some confusion i felt that you were pleased with me if you mean that and youve felt when other people were pleased with you he insisted well sometimes the men in town at the banks and the county offices seem glad to see me i think myself it is more pleasant to do business with people who are clean and healthylooking she admitted blandly carl gave a little chuckle as he opened the shabatas gate for her oh do you he asked dryly there was no sign of life about the shabatas house except a big yellow cat sunning itself on the kitchen doorstep alexandra took the path that led to the orchard she often sits there and sews i didnt telephone her we were coming because i didnt want her to go to work and bake cake and freeze icecream shell always make a party if you give her the least excuse do you recognize the apple trees carl linstrum looked about him i wish i had a dollar for every bucket of water ive carried for those trees poor father he was an easy man but he was perfectly merciless when it came to watering the orchard thats one thing i like about germans they make an orchard grow if they cant make anything else im so glad these trees belong to some one who takes comfort in them when i rented this place the tenants never kept the orchard up and emil and i used to come over and take care of it ourselves it needs mowing now there she is down in the corner mariaaa she called a recumbent figure started up from the grass and came running toward them through the flickering screen of light and shade look at her isnt she like a little brown rabbit alexandra laughed maria ran up panting and threw her arms about alexandra oh i had begun to think you were not coming at all maybe i knew you were so busy yes emil told me about mr linstrum being here wont you come up to the house why not sit down there in your corner carl wants to see the orchard he kept all these trees alive for years watering them with his own back marie turned to carl then im thankful to you mr linstrum wed never have bought the place if it hadnt been for this orchard and then i wouldnt have had alexandra either she gave alexandras arm a little squeeze as she walked beside her how nice your dress smells alexandra you put rosemary leaves in your chest like i told you she led them to the northwest corner of the orchard sheltered on one side by a thick mulberry hedge and bordered on the other by a wheatfield just beginning to yellow in this corner the ground dipped a little and the bluegrass which the weeds had driven out in the upper part of the orchard grew thick and luxuriant wild roses were flaming in the tufts of bunchgrass along the fence under a white mulberry tree there was an old wagonseat beside it lay a book and a workbasket you must have the seat alexandra the grass would stain your dress the hostess insisted she dropped down on the ground at alexandras side and tucked her feet under her carl sat at a little distance from the two women his back to the wheatfield and watched them alexandra took off her shadehat and threw it on the ground marie picked it up and played with the white ribbons twisting them about her brown fingers as she talked they made a pretty picture in the strong sunlight the leafy pattern surrounding them like a net the swedish woman so white and gold kindly and amused but armored in calm and the alert brown one her full lips parted points of yellow light dancing in her eyes as she laughed and chattered carl had never forgotten little marie toveskys eyes and he was glad to have an opportunity to study them the brown iris he found was curiously slashed with yellow the color of sunflower honey or of old amber in each eye one of these streaks must have been larger than the others for the effect was that of two dancing points of light two little yellow bubbles such as rise in a glass of champagne sometimes they seemed like the sparks from a forge she seemed so easily excited to kindle with a fierce little flame if one but breathed upon her what a waste carl reflected she ought to be doing all that for a sweetheart how awkwardly things come about it was not very long before marie sprang up out of the grass again wait a moment i want to show you something she ran away and disappeared behind the lowgrowing apple trees what a charming creature carl murmured i dont wonder that her husband is jealous but cant she walk does she always run alexandra nodded always i dont see many people but i dont believe there are many like her anywhere marie came back with a branch she had broken from an apricot tree laden with pale yellow pinkcheeked fruit she dropped it beside carl did you plant those too they are such beautiful little trees carl fingered the bluegreen leaves porous like blottingpaper and shaped like birch leaves hung on waxen red stems yes i think i did are these the circus trees alexandra shall i tell her about them alexandra asked sit down like a good girl marie and dont ruin my poor hat and ill tell you a story a long time ago when carl and i were say sixteen and twelve a circus came to hanover and we went to town in our wagon with lou and oscar to see the parade we hadnt money enough to go to the circus we followed the parade out to the circus grounds and hung around until the show began and the crowd went inside the tent then lou was afraid we looked foolish standing outside in the pasture so we went back to hanover feeling very sad there was a man in the streets selling apricots and we had never seen any before he had driven down from somewhere up in the french country and he was selling them twentyfive cents a peck we had a little money our fathers had given us for candy and i bought two pecks and carl bought one they cheered us a good deal and we saved all the seeds and planted them up to the time carl went away they hadnt borne at all and now hes come back to eat them cried marie nodding at carl that is a good story i can remember you a little mr linstrum i used to see you in hanover sometimes when uncle joe took me to town i remember you because you were always buying pencils and tubes of paint at the drug store once when my uncle left me at the store you drew a lot of little birds and flowers for me on a piece of wrappingpaper i kept them for a long while i thought you were very romantic because you could draw and had such black eyes carl smiled yes i remember that time your uncle bought you some kind of a mechanical toy a turkish lady sitting on an ottoman and smoking a hookah wasnt it and she turned her head backwards and forwards oh yes wasnt she splendid i knew well enough i ought not to tell uncle joe i wanted it for he had just come back from the saloon and was feeling good you remember how he laughed she tickled him too but when we got home my aunt scolded him for buying toys when she needed so many things we wound our lady up every night and when she began to move her head my aunt used to laugh as hard as any of us it was a musicbox you know and the turkish lady played a tune while she smoked that was how she made you feel so jolly as i remember her she was lovely and had a gold crescent on her turban half an hour later as they were leaving the house carl and alexandra were met in the path by a strapping fellow in overalls and a blue shirt he was breathing hard as if he had been running and was muttering to himself marie ran forward and taking him by the arm gave him a little push toward her guests frank this is mr linstrum frank took off his broad straw hat and nodded to alexandra when he spoke to carl he showed a fine set of white teeth he was burned a dull red down to his neckband and there was a heavy threedays stubble on his face even in his agitation he was handsome but he looked a rash and violent man barely saluting the callers he turned at once to his wife and began in an outraged tone i have to leave my team to drive the old woman hillers hogs outa my wheat i go to take dat old woman to de court if she aint careful i tell you his wife spoke soothingly but frank she has only her lame boy to help her she does the best she can alexandra looked at the excited man and offered a suggestion why dont you go over there some afternoon and hogtight her fences youd save time for yourself in the end franks neck stiffened notamuch i wont i keep my hogs home other peoples can do like me see if that louis can mend shoes he can mend fence maybe said alexandra placidly but ive found it sometimes pays to mend other peoples fences goodbye marie come to see me soon alexandra walked firmly down the path and carl followed her frank went into the house and threw himself on the sofa his face to the wall his clenched fist on his hip marie having seen her guests off came in and put her hand coaxingly on his shoulder poor frank youve run until youve made your head ache now havent you let me make you some coffee what else am i to do he cried hotly in bohemian am i to let any old womans hogs root up my wheat is that what i work myself to death for dont worry about it frank ill speak to mrs hiller again but really she almost cried last time they got out she was so sorry frank bounced over on his other side thats it you always side with them against me they all know it anybody here feels free to borrow the mower and break it or turn their hogs in on me they know you wont care marie hurried away to make his coffee when she came back he was fast asleep she sat down and looked at him for a long while very thoughtfully when the kitchen clock struck six she went out to get supper closing the door gently behind her she was always sorry for frank when he worked himself into one of these rages and she was sorry to have him rough and quarrelsome with his neighbors she was perfectly aware that the neighbors had a good deal to put up with and that they bore with frank for her sake vii maries father albert tovesky was one of the more intelligent bohemians who came west in the early seventies he settled in omaha and became a leader and adviser among his people there marie was his youngest child by a second wife and was the apple of his eye she was barely sixteen and was in the graduating class of the omaha high school when frank shabata arrived from the old country and set all the bohemian girls in a flutter he was easily the buck of the beergardens and on sunday he was a sight to see with his silk hat and tucked shirt and blue frockcoat wearing gloves and carrying a little wisp of a yellow cane he was tall and fair with splendid teeth and closecropped yellow curls and he wore a slightly disdainful expression proper for a young man with high connections whose mother had a big farm in the elbe valley there was often an interesting discontent in his blue eyes and every bohemian girl he met imagined herself the cause of that unsatisfied expression he had a way of drawing out his cambric handkerchief slowly by one corner from his breastpocket that was melancholy and romantic in the extreme he took a little flight with each of the more eligible bohemian girls but it was when he was with little marie tovesky that he drew his handkerchief out most slowly and after he had lit a fresh cigar dropped the match most despairingly any one could see with half an eye that his proud heart was bleeding for somebody one sunday late in the summer after maries graduation she met frank at a bohemian picnic down the river and went rowing with him all the afternoon when she got home that evening she went straight to her fathers room and told him that she was engaged to shabata old tovesky was having a comfortable pipe before he went to bed when he heard his daughters announcement he first prudently corked his beer bottle and then leaped to his feet and had a turn of temper he characterized frank shabata by a bohemian expression which is the equivalent of stuffed shirt why dont he go to work like the rest of us did his farm in the elbe valley indeed aint he got plenty brothers and sisters its his mothers farm and why dont he stay at home and help her havent i seen his mother out in the morning at five oclock with her ladle and her big bucket on wheels putting liquid manure on the cabbages dont i know the look of old eva shabatas hands like an old horses hoofs they areand this fellow wearing gloves and rings engaged indeed you arent fit to be out of school and thats whats the matter with you i will send you off to the sisters of the sacred heart in st louis and they will teach you some sense i guess accordingly the very next week albert tovesky took his daughter pale and tearful down the river to the convent but the way to make frank want anything was to tell him he couldnt have it he managed to have an interview with marie before she went away and whereas he had been only half in love with her before he now persuaded himself that he would not stop at anything marie took with her to the convent under the canvas lining of her trunk the results of a laborious and satisfying morning on franks part no less than a dozen photographs of himself taken in a dozen different lovelorn attitudes there was a little round photograph for her watchcase photographs for her wall and dresser and even long narrow ones to be used as bookmarks more than once the handsome gentleman was torn to pieces before the french class by an indignant nun marie pined in the convent for a year until her eighteenth birthday was passed then she met frank shabata in the union station in st louis and ran away with him old tovesky forgave his daughter because there was nothing else to do and bought her a farm in the country that she had loved so well as a child since then her story had been a part of the history of the divide she and frank had been living there for five years when carl linstrum came back to pay his long deferred visit to alexandra frank had on the whole done better than one might have expected he had flung himself at the soil with savage energy once a year he went to hastings or to omaha on a spree he stayed away for a week or two and then came home and worked like a demon he did work if he felt sorry for himself that was his own affair viii on the evening of the day of alexandras call at the shabatas a heavy rain set in frank sat up until a late hour reading the sunday newspapers one of the goulds was getting a divorce and frank took it as a personal affront in printing the story of the young mans marital troubles the knowing editor gave a sufficiently colored account of his career stating the amount of his income and the manner in which he was supposed to spend it frank read english slowly and the more he read about this divorce case the angrier he grew at last he threw down the page with a snort he turned to his farmhand who was reading the other half of the paper by god if i have that young feller in de hayfield once i show him someting listen here what he do wit his money and frank began the catalogue of the young mans reputed extravagances marie sighed she thought it hard that the goulds for whom she had nothing but good will should make her so much trouble she hated to see the sunday newspapers come into the house frank was always reading about the doings of rich people and feeling outraged he had an inexhaustible stock of stories about their crimes and follies how they bribed the courts and shot down their butlers with impunity whenever they chose frank and lou bergson had very similar ideas and they were two of the political agitators of the county the next morning broke clear and brilliant but frank said the ground was too wet to plough so he took the cart and drove over to sainteagnes to spend the day at moses marcels saloon after he was gone marie went out to the back porch to begin her buttermaking a brisk wind had come up and was driving puffy white clouds across the sky the orchard was sparkling and rippling in the sun marie stood looking toward it wistfully her hand on the lid of the churn when she heard a sharp ring in the air the merry sound of the whetstone on the scythe that invitation decided her she ran into the house put on a short skirt and a pair of her husbands boots caught up a tin pail and started for the orchard emil had already begun work and was mowing vigorously when he saw her coming he stopped and wiped his brow his yellow canvas leggings and khaki trousers were splashed to the knees dont let me disturb you emil im going to pick cherries isnt everything beautiful after the rain oh but im glad to get this place mowed when i heard it raining in the night i thought maybe you would come and do it for me today the wind wakened me didnt it blow dreadfully just smell the wild roses they are always so spicy after a rain we never had so many of them in here before i suppose its the wet season will you have to cut them too if i cut the grass i will emil said teasingly whats the matter with you what makes you so flighty am i flighty i suppose thats the wet season too then its exciting to see everything growing so fastand to get the grass cut please leave the roses till last if you must cut them oh i dont mean all of them i mean that low place down by my tree where there are so many arent you splashed look at the spiderwebs all over the grass goodbye ill call you if i see a snake she tripped away and emil stood looking after her in a few moments he heard the cherries dropping smartly into the pail and he began to swing his scythe with that long even stroke that few american boys ever learn marie picked cherries and sang softly to herself stripping one glittering branch after another shivering when she caught a shower of raindrops on her neck and hair and emil mowed his way slowly down toward the cherry trees that summer the rains had been so many and opportune that it was almost more than shabata and his man could do to keep up with the corn the orchard was a neglected wilderness all sorts of weeds and herbs and flowers had grown up there splotches of wild larkspur pale greenandwhite spikes of hoarhound plantations of wild cotton tangles of foxtail and wild wheat south of the apricot trees cornering on the wheatfield was franks alfalfa where myriads of white and yellow butterflies were always fluttering above the purple blossoms when emil reached the lower corner by the hedge marie was sitting under her white mulberry tree the pailful of cherries beside her looking off at the gentle tireless swelling of the wheat emil she said suddenlyhe was mowing quietly about under the tree so as not to disturb herwhat religion did the swedes have away back before they were christians emil paused and straightened his back i dont know about like the germans wasnt it marie went on as if she had not heard him the bohemians you know were tree worshipers before the missionaries came father says the people in the mountains still do queer things sometimesthey believe that trees bring good or bad luck emil looked superior do they well which are the lucky trees id like to know i dont know all of them but i know lindens are the old people in the mountains plant lindens to purify the forest and to do away with the spells that come from the old trees they say have lasted from heathen times im a good catholic but i think i could get along with caring for trees if i hadnt anything else thats a poor saying said emil stooping over to wipe his hands in the wet grass why is it if i feel that way i feel that way i like trees because they seem more resigned to the way they have to live than other things do i feel as if this tree knows everything i ever think of when i sit here when i come back to it i never have to remind it of anything i begin just where i left off emil had nothing to say to this he reached up among the branches and began to pick the sweet insipid fruitlong ivorycolored berries tipped with faint pink like white coral that fall to the ground unheeded all summer through he dropped a handful into her lap do you like mr linstrum marie asked suddenly yes dont you oh ever so much only he seems kind of staid and schoolteachery but of course he is older than frank even im sure i dont want to live to be more than thirty do you do you think alexandra likes him very much i suppose so they were old friends oh emil you know what i mean marie tossed her head impatiently does she really care about him when she used to tell me about him i always wondered whether she wasnt a little in love with him who alexandra emil laughed and thrust his hands into his trousers pockets alexandras never been in love you crazy he laughed again she wouldnt know how to go about it the idea marie shrugged her shoulders oh you dont know alexandra as well as you think you do if you had any eyes you would see that she is very fond of him it would serve you all right if she walked off with carl i like him because he appreciates her more than you do emil frowned what are you talking about marie alexandras all right she and i have always been good friends what more do you want i like to talk to carl about new york and what a fellow can do there oh emil surely you are not thinking of going off there why not i must go somewhere mustnt i the young man took up his scythe and leaned on it would you rather i went off in the sand hills and lived like ivar maries face fell under his brooding gaze she looked down at his wet leggings im sure alexandra hopes you will stay on here she murmured then alexandra will be disappointed the young man said roughly what do i want to hang around here for alexandra can run the farm all right without me i dont want to stand around and look on i want to be doing something on my own account thats so marie sighed there are so many many things you can do almost anything you choose and there are so many many things i cant do emil echoed her tone sarcastically sometimes i dont want to do anything at all and sometimes i want to pull the four corners of the divide togetherhe threw out his arm and brought it back with a jerkso like a tablecloth i get tired of seeing men and horses going up and down up and down marie looked up at his defiant figure and her face clouded i wish you werent so restless and didnt get so worked up over things she said sadly thank you he returned shortly she sighed despondently everything i say makes you cross dont it and you never used to be cross to me emil took a step nearer and stood frowning down at her bent head he stood in an attitude of selfdefense his feet well apart his hands clenched and drawn up at his sides so that the cords stood out on his bare arms i cant play with you like a little boy any more he said slowly thats what you miss marie youll have to get some other little boy to play with he stopped and took a deep breath then he went on in a low tone so intense that it was almost threatening sometimes you seem to understand perfectly and then sometimes you pretend you dont you dont help things any by pretending its then that i want to pull the corners of the divide together if you wont understand you know i could make you marie clasped her hands and started up from her seat she had grown very pale and her eyes were shining with excitement and distress but emil if i understand then all our good times are over we can never do nice things together any more we shall have to behave like mr linstrum and anyhow theres nothing to understand she struck the ground with her little foot fiercely that wont last it will go away and things will be just as they used to i wish you were a catholic the church helps people indeed it does i pray for you but thats not the same as if you prayed yourself she spoke rapidly and pleadingly looked entreatingly into his face emil stood defiant gazing down at her i cant pray to have the things i want he said slowly and i wont pray not to have them not if im damned for it marie turned away wringing her hands oh emil you wont try then all our good times are over yes over i never expect to have any more emil gripped the handholds of his scythe and began to mow marie took up her cherries and went slowly toward the house crying bitterly ix on sunday afternoon a month after carl linstrums arrival he rode with emil up into the french country to attend a catholic fair he sat for most of the afternoon in the basement of the church where the fair was held talking to marie shabata or strolled about the gravel terrace thrown up on the hillside in front of the basement doors where the french boys were jumping and wrestling and throwing the discus some of the boys were in their white baseball suits they had just come up from a sunday practice game down in the ballgrounds amedee the newly married emils best friend was their pitcher renowned among the country towns for his dash and skill amedee was a little fellow a year younger than emil and much more boyish in appearance very lithe and active and neatly made with a clear brown and white skin and flashing white teeth the sainteagnes boys were to play the hastings nine in a fortnight and amedees lightning balls were the hope of his team the little frenchman seemed to get every ounce there was in him behind the ball as it left his hand youd have made the battery at the university for sure medee emil said as they were walking from the ballgrounds back to the church on the hill youre pitching better than you did in the spring amedee grinned sure a married man dont lose his head no more he slapped emil on the back as he caught step with him oh emil you wanna get married right off quick its the greatest thing ever emil laughed how am i going to get married without any girl amedee took his arm pooh there are plenty girls will have you you wanna get some nice french girl now she treat you well always be jolly seehe began checking off on his fingersthere is severine and alphosen and josephine and hectorine and louise and malvinawhy i could love any of them girls why dont you get after them are you stuck up emil or is anything the matter with you i never did know a boy twentytwo years old before that didnt have no girl you wanna be a priest maybe nota for me amedee swaggered i bring many good catholics into this world i hope and thats a way i help the church emil looked down and patted him on the shoulder now youre windy medee you frenchies like to brag but amedee had the zeal of the newly married and he was not to be lightly shaken off honest and true emil dont you want any girl maybe theres some young lady in lincoln now very grandamedee waved his hand languidly before his face to denote the fan of heartless beautyand you lost your heart up there is that it maybe said emil but amedee saw no appropriate glow in his friends face bah he exclaimed in disgust i tell all the french girls to keep way from you you gotta rock in there thumping emil on the ribs when they reached the terrace at the side of the church amedee who was excited by his success on the ballgrounds challenged emil to a jumpingmatch though he knew he would be beaten they belted themselves up and raoul marcel the choir tenor and father duchesnes pet and jean bordelau held the string over which they vaulted all the french boys stood round cheering and humping themselves up when emil or amedee went over the wire as if they were helping in the lift emil stopped at fivefeetfive declaring that he would spoil his appetite for supper if he jumped any more angelique amedees pretty bride as blonde and fair as her name who had come out to watch the match tossed her head at emil and said medee could jump much higher than you if he were as tall and anyhow he is much more graceful he goes over like a bird and you have to hump yourself all up oh i do do i emil caught her and kissed her saucy mouth squarely while she laughed and struggled and called medee medee there you see your medee isnt even big enough to get you away from me i could run away with you right now and he could only sit down and cry about it ill show you whether i have to hump myself laughing and panting he picked angelique up in his arms and began running about the rectangle with her not until he saw marie shabatas tiger eyes flashing from the gloom of the basement doorway did he hand the disheveled bride over to her husband there go to your graceful i havent the heart to take you away from him angelique clung to her husband and made faces at emil over the white shoulder of amedees ballshirt emil was greatly amused at her air of proprietorship and at amedees shameless submission to it he was delighted with his friends good fortune he liked to see and to think about amedees sunny natural happy love he and amedee had ridden and wrestled and larked together since they were lads of twelve on sundays and holidays they were always arm in arm it seemed strange that now he should have to hide the thing that amedee was so proud of that the feeling which gave one of them such happiness should bring the other such despair it was like that when alexandra tested her seedcorn in the spring he mused from two ears that had grown side by side the grains of one shot up joyfully into the light projecting themselves into the future and the grains from the other lay still in the earth and rotted and nobody knew why x while emil and carl were amusing themselves at the fair alexandra was at home busy with her accountbooks which had been neglected of late she was almost through with her figures when she heard a cart drive up to the gate and looking out of the window she saw her two older brothers they had seemed to avoid her ever since carl linstrums arrival four weeks ago that day and she hurried to the door to welcome them she saw at once that they had come with some very definite purpose they followed her stiffly into the sittingroom oscar sat down but lou walked over to the window and remained standing his hands behind him you are by yourself he asked looking toward the doorway into the parlor yes carl and emil went up to the catholic fair for a few moments neither of the men spoke then lou came out sharply how soon does he intend to go away from here i dont know lou not for some time i hope alexandra spoke in an even quiet tone that often exasperated her brothers they felt that she was trying to be superior with them oscar spoke up grimly we thought we ought to tell you that people have begun to talk he said meaningly alexandra looked at him what about oscar met her eyes blankly about you keeping him here so long it looks bad for him to be hanging on to a woman this way people think youre getting taken in alexandra shut her accountbook firmly boys she said seriously dont lets go on with this we wont come out anywhere i cant take advice on such a matter i know you mean well but you must not feel responsible for me in things of this sort if we go on with this talk it will only make hard feeling lou whipped about from the window you ought to think a little about your family youre making us all ridiculous how am i people are beginning to say you want to marry the fellow well and what is ridiculous about that lou and oscar exchanged outraged looks alexandra cant you see hes just a tramp and hes after your money he wants to be taken care of he does well suppose i want to take care of him whose business is it but my own dont you know hed get hold of your property hed get hold of what i wished to give him certainly oscar sat up suddenly and lou clutched at his bristly hair give him lou shouted our property our homestead i dont know about the homestead said alexandra quietly i know you and oscar have always expected that it would be left to your children and im not sure but what youre right but ill do exactly as i please with the rest of my land boys the rest of your land cried lou growing more excited every minute didnt all the land come out of the homestead it was bought with money borrowed on the homestead and oscar and me worked ourselves to the bone paying interest on it yes you paid the interest but when you married we made a division of the land and you were satisfied ive made more on my farms since ive been alone than when we all worked together everything youve made has come out of the original land that us boys worked for hasnt it the farms and all that comes out of them belongs to us as a family alexandra waved her hand impatiently come now lou stick to the facts you are talking nonsense go to the county clerk and ask him who owns my land and whether my titles are good lou turned to his brother this is what comes of letting a woman meddle in business he said bitterly we ought to have taken things in our own hands years ago but she liked to run things and we humored her we thought you had good sense alexandra we never thought youd do anything foolish alexandra rapped impatiently on her desk with her knuckles listen lou dont talk wild you say you ought to have taken things into your own hands years ago i suppose you mean before you left home but how could you take hold of what wasnt there ive got most of what i have now since we divided the property ive built it up myself and it has nothing to do with you oscar spoke up solemnly the property of a family really belongs to the men of the family no matter about the title if anything goes wrong its the men that are held responsible yes of course lou broke in everybody knows that oscar and me have always been easygoing and weve never made any fuss we were willing you should hold the land and have the good of it but you got no right to part with any of it we worked in the fields to pay for the first land you bought and whatevers come out of it has got to be kept in the family oscar reinforced his brother his mind fixed on the one point he could see the property of a family belongs to the men of the family because they are held responsible and because they do the work alexandra looked from one to the other her eyes full of indignation she had been impatient before but now she was beginning to feel angry and what about my work she asked in an unsteady voice lou looked at the carpet oh now alexandra you always took it pretty easy of course we wanted you to you liked to manage round and we always humored you we realize you were a great deal of help to us theres no woman anywhere around that knows as much about business as you do and weve always been proud of that and thought you were pretty smart but of course the real work always fell on us good advice is all right but it dont get the weeds out of the corn maybe not but it sometimes puts in the crop and it sometimes keeps the fields for corn to grow in said alexandra dryly why lou i can remember when you and oscar wanted to sell this homestead and all the improvements to old preacher ericson for two thousand dollars if id consented youd have gone down to the river and scraped along on poor farms for the rest of your lives when i put in our first field of alfalfa you both opposed me just because i first heard about it from a young man who had been to the university you said i was being taken in then and all the neighbors said so you know as well as i do that alfalfa has been the salvation of this country you all laughed at me when i said our land here was about ready for wheat and i had to raise three big wheat crops before the neighbors quit putting all their land in corn why i remember you cried lou when we put in the first big wheatplanting and said everybody was laughing at us lou turned to oscar thats the woman of it if she tells you to put in a crop she thinks shes put it in it makes women conceited to meddle in business i shouldnt think youd want to remind us how hard you were on us alexandra after the way you baby emil hard on you i never meant to be hard conditions were hard maybe i would never have been very soft anyhow but i certainly didnt choose to be the kind of girl i was if you take even a vine and cut it back again and again it grows hard like a tree lou felt that they were wandering from the point and that in digression alexandra might unnerve him he wiped his forehead with a jerk of his handkerchief we never doubted you alexandra we never questioned anything you did youve always had your own way but you cant expect us to sit like stumps and see you done out of the property by any loafer who happens along and making yourself ridiculous into the bargain oscar rose yes he broke in everybodys laughing to see you get took in at your age too everybody knows hes nearly five years younger than you and is after your money why alexandra you are forty years old all that doesnt concern anybody but carl and me go to town and ask your lawyers what you can do to restrain me from disposing of my own property and i advise you to do what they tell you for the authority you can exert by law is the only influence you will ever have over me again alexandra rose i think i would rather not have lived to find out what i have today she said quietly closing her desk lou and oscar looked at each other questioningly there seemed to be nothing to do but to go and they walked out you cant do business with women oscar said heavily as he clambered into the cart but anyhow weve had our say at last lou scratched his head talk of that kind might come too high you know but shes apt to be sensible you hadnt ought to said that about her age though oscar im afraid that hurt her feelings and the worst thing we can do is to make her sore at us shed marry him out of contrariness i only meant said oscar that she is old enough to know better and she is if she was going to marry she ought to done it long ago and not go making a fool of herself now lou looked anxious nevertheless of course he reflected hopefully and inconsistently alexandra aint much like other womenfolks maybe it wont make her sore maybe shed as soon be forty as not xi emil came home at about halfpast seven oclock that evening old ivar met him at the windmill and took his horse and the young man went directly into the house he called to his sister and she answered from her bedroom behind the sittingroom saying that she was lying down emil went to her door can i see you for a minute he asked i want to talk to you about something before carl comes alexandra rose quickly and came to the door where is carl lou and oscar met us and said they wanted to talk to him so he rode over to oscars with them are you coming out emil asked impatiently yes sit down ill be dressed in a moment alexandra closed her door and emil sank down on the old slat lounge and sat with his head in his hands when his sister came out he looked up not knowing whether the interval had been short or long and he was surprised to see that the room had grown quite dark that was just as well it would be easier to talk if he were not under the gaze of those clear deliberate eyes that saw so far in some directions and were so blind in others alexandra too was glad of the dusk her face was swollen from crying emil started up and then sat down again alexandra he said slowly in his deep young baritone i dont want to go away to law school this fall let me put it off another year i want to take a year off and look around its awfully easy to rush into a profession you dont really like and awfully hard to get out of it linstrum and i have been talking about that very well emil only dont go off looking for land she came up and put her hand on his shoulder ive been wishing you could stay with me this winter thats just what i dont want to do alexandra im restless i want to go to a new place i want to go down to the city of mexico to join one of the university fellows whos at the head of an electrical plant he wrote me he could give me a little job enough to pay my way and i could look around and see what i want to do i want to go as soon as harvest is over i guess lou and oscar will be sore about it i suppose they will alexandra sat down on the lounge beside him they are very angry with me emil we have had a quarrel they will not come here again emil scarcely heard what she was saying he did not notice the sadness of her tone he was thinking about the reckless life he meant to live in mexico what about he asked absently about carl linstrum they are afraid i am going to marry him and that some of my property will get away from them emil shrugged his shoulders what nonsense he murmured just like them alexandra drew back why nonsense emil why youve never thought of such a thing have you they always have to have something to fuss about emil said his sister slowly you ought not to take things for granted do you agree with them that i have no right to change my way of living emil looked at the outline of his sisters head in the dim light they were sitting close together and he somehow felt that she could hear his thoughts he was silent for a moment and then said in an embarrassed tone why no certainly not you ought to do whatever you want to ill always back you but it would seem a little bit ridiculous to you if i married carl emil fidgeted the issue seemed to him too farfetched to warrant discussion why no i should be surprised if you wanted to i cant see exactly why but thats none of my business you ought to do as you please certainly you ought not to pay any attention to what the boys say alexandra sighed i had hoped you might understand a little why i do want to but i suppose thats too much to expect ive had a pretty lonely life emil besides marie carl is the only friend i have ever had emil was awake now a name in her last sentence roused him he put out his hand and took his sisters awkwardly you ought to do just as you wish and i think carls a fine fellow he and i would always get on i dont believe any of the things the boys say about him honest i dont they are suspicious of him because hes intelligent you know their way theyve been sore at me ever since you let me go away to college theyre always trying to catch me up if i were you i wouldnt pay any attention to them theres nothing to get upset about carls a sensible fellow he wont mind them i dont know if they talk to him the way they did to me i think hell go away emil grew more and more uneasy think so well marie said it would serve us all right if you walked off with him did she bless her little heart she would alexandras voice broke emil began unlacing his leggings why dont you talk to her about it theres carl i hear his horse i guess ill go upstairs and get my boots off no i dont want any supper we had supper at five oclock at the fair emil was glad to escape and get to his own room he was a little ashamed for his sister though he had tried not to show it he felt that there was something indecorous in her proposal and she did seem to him somewhat ridiculous there was trouble enough in the world he reflected as he threw himself upon his bed without people who were forty years old imagining they wanted to get married in the darkness and silence emil was not likely to think long about alexandra every image slipped away but one he had seen marie in the crowd that afternoon she sold candy at the fair why had she ever run away with frank shabata and how could she go on laughing and working and taking an interest in things why did she like so many people and why had she seemed pleased when all the french and bohemian boys and the priest himself crowded round her candy stand why did she care about any one but him why could he never never find the thing he looked for in her playful affectionate eyes then he fell to imagining that he looked once more and found it there and what it would be like if she loved himshe who as alexandra said could give her whole heart in that dream he could lie for hours as if in a trance his spirit went out of his body and crossed the fields to marie shabata at the university dances the girls had often looked wonderingly at the tall young swede with the fine head leaning against the wall and frowning his arms folded his eyes fixed on the ceiling or the floor all the girls were a little afraid of him he was distinguishedlooking and not the jollying kind they felt that he was too intense and preoccupied there was something queer about him emils fraternity rather prided itself upon its dances and sometimes he did his duty and danced every dance but whether he was on the floor or brooding in a corner he was always thinking about marie shabata for two years the storm had been gathering in him xii carl came into the sittingroom while alexandra was lighting the lamp she looked up at him as she adjusted the shade his sharp shoulders stooped as if he were very tired his face was pale and there were bluish shadows under his dark eyes his anger had burned itself out and left him sick and disgusted you have seen lou and oscar alexandra asked yes his eyes avoided hers alexandra took a deep breath and now you are going away i thought so carl threw himself into a chair and pushed the dark lock back from his forehead with his white nervous hand what a hopeless position you are in alexandra he exclaimed feverishly it is your fate to be always surrounded by little men and i am no better than the rest i am too little to face the criticism of even such men as lou and oscar yes i am going away tomorrow i cannot even ask you to give me a promise until i have something to offer you i thought perhaps i could do that but i find i cant what good comes of offering people things they dont need alexandra asked sadly i dont need money but i have needed you for a great many years i wonder why i have been permitted to prosper if it is only to take my friends away from me i dont deceive myself carl said frankly i know that i am going away on my own account i must make the usual effort i must have something to show for myself to take what you would give me i should have to be either a very large man or a very small one and i am only in the middle class alexandra sighed i have a feeling that if you go away you will not come back something will happen to one of us or to both people have to snatch at happiness when they can in this world it is always easier to lose than to find what i have is yours if you care enough about me to take it carl rose and looked up at the picture of john bergson but i cant my dear i cant i will go north at once instead of idling about in california all winter i shall be getting my bearings up there i wont waste another week be patient with me alexandra give me a year as you will said alexandra wearily all at once in a single day i lose everything and i do not know why emil too is going away carl was still studying john bergsons face and alexandras eyes followed his yes she said if he could have seen all that would come of the task he gave me he would have been sorry i hope he does not see me now i hope that he is among the old people of his blood and country and that tidings do not reach him from the new world part iii winter memories i winter has settled down over the divide again the season in which nature recuperates in which she sinks to sleep between the fruitfulness of autumn and the passion of spring the birds have gone the teeming life that goes on down in the long grass is exterminated the prairiedog keeps his hole the rabbits run shivering from one frozen garden patch to another and are hard put to it to find frostbitten cabbagestalks at night the coyotes roam the wintry waste howling for food the variegated fields are all one color now the pastures the stubble the roads the sky are the same leaden gray the hedgerows and trees are scarcely perceptible against the bare earth whose slaty hue they have taken on the ground is frozen so hard that it bruises the foot to walk in the roads or in the ploughed fields it is like an iron country and the spirit is oppressed by its rigor and melancholy one could easily believe that in that dead landscape the germs of life and fruitfulness were extinct forever alexandra has settled back into her old routine there are weekly letters from emil lou and oscar she has not seen since carl went away to avoid awkward encounters in the presence of curious spectators she has stopped going to the norwegian church and drives up to the reform church at hanover or goes with marie shabata to the catholic church locally known as the french church she has not told marie about carl or her differences with her brothers she was never very communicative about her own affairs and when she came to the point an instinct told her that about such things she and marie would not understand one another old mrs lee had been afraid that family misunderstandings might deprive her of her yearly visit to alexandra but on the first day of december alexandra telephoned annie that tomorrow she would send ivar over for her mother and the next day the old lady arrived with her bundles for twelve years mrs lee had always entered alexandras sittingroom with the same exclamation now we be yusta like old times she enjoyed the liberty alexandra gave her and hearing her own language about her all day long here she could wear her nightcap and sleep with all her windows shut listen to ivar reading the bible and here she could run about among the stables in a pair of emils old boots though she was bent almost double she was as spry as a gopher her face was as brown as if it had been varnished and as full of wrinkles as a washerwomans hands she had three jolly old teeth left in the front of her mouth and when she grinned she looked very knowing as if when you found out how to take it life wasnt half bad while she and alexandra patched and pieced and quilted she talked incessantly about stories she read in a swedish family paper telling the plots in great detail or about her life on a dairy farm in gottland when she was a girl sometimes she forgot which were the printed stories and which were the real stories it all seemed so far away she loved to take a little brandy with hot water and sugar before she went to bed and alexandra always had it ready for her it sends good dreams she would say with a twinkle in her eye when mrs lee had been with alexandra for a week marie shabata telephoned one morning to say that frank had gone to town for the day and she would like them to come over for coffee in the afternoon mrs lee hurried to wash out and iron her new crossstitched apron which she had finished only the night before a checked gingham apron worked with a design ten inches broad across the bottom a hunting scene with fir trees and a stag and dogs and huntsmen mrs lee was firm with herself at dinner and refused a second helping of apple dumplings i taank i save up she said with a giggle at two oclock in the afternoon alexandras cart drove up to the shabatas gate and marie saw mrs lees red shawl come bobbing up the path she ran to the door and pulled the old woman into the house with a hug helping her to take off her wraps while alexandra blanketed the horse outside mrs lee had put on her best black satine dressshe abominated woolen stuffs even in winterand a crocheted collar fastened with a big pale gold pin containing faded daguerreotypes of her father and mother she had not worn her apron for fear of rumpling it and now she shook it out and tied it round her waist with a conscious air marie drew back and threw up her hands exclaiming oh what a beauty ive never seen this one before have i mrs lee the old woman giggled and ducked her head no yust las night i maake see dis tread verra strong no waash out no fade my sister send from sveden i yusta taank you like dis marie ran to the door again come in alexandra i have been looking at mrs lees apron do stop on your way home and show it to mrs hiller shes crazy about crossstitch while alexandra removed her hat and veil mrs lee went out to the kitchen and settled herself in a wooden rockingchair by the stove looking with great interest at the table set for three with a white cloth and a pot of pink geraniums in the middle my aant you gotta fine plants sucha much flower how you keep from freeze she pointed to the windowshelves full of blooming fuchsias and geraniums i keep the fire all night mrs lee and when its very cold i put them all on the table in the middle of the room other nights i only put newspapers behind them frank laughs at me for fussing but when they dont bloom he says whats the matter with the darned thingswhat do you hear from carl alexandra he got to dawson before the river froze and now i suppose i wont hear any more until spring before he left california he sent me a box of orange flowers but they didnt keep very well i have brought a bunch of emils letters for you alexandra came out from the sittingroom and pinched maries cheek playfully you dont look as if the weather ever froze you up never have colds do you thats a good girl she had dark red cheeks like this when she was a little girl mrs lee she looked like some queer foreign kind of a doll ive never forgot the first time i saw you in mieklejohns store marie the time father was lying sick carl and i were talking about that before he went away i remember and emil had his kitten along when are you going to send emils christmas box it ought to have gone before this ill have to send it by mail now to get it there in time marie pulled a dark purple silk necktie from her workbasket i knit this for him its a good color dont you think will you please put it in with your things and tell him its from me to wear when he goes serenading alexandra laughed i dont believe he goes serenading much he says in one letter that the mexican ladies are said to be very beautiful but that dont seem to me very warm praise marie tossed her head emil cant fool me if hes bought a guitar he goes serenading who wouldnt with all those spanish girls dropping flowers down from their windows id sing to them every night wouldnt you mrs lee the old lady chuckled her eyes lit up as marie bent down and opened the oven door a delicious hot fragrance blew out into the tidy kitchen my someting smell good she turned to alexandra with a wink her three yellow teeth making a brave show i taank dat stop my yaw from ache no more she said contentedly marie took out a pan of delicate little rolls stuffed with stewed apricots and began to dust them over with powdered sugar i hope youll like these mrs lee alexandra does the bohemians always like them with their coffee but if you dont i have a coffeecake with nuts and poppy seeds alexandra will you get the cream jug i put it in the window to keep cool the bohemians said alexandra as they drew up to the table certainly know how to make more kinds of bread than any other people in the world old mrs hiller told me once at the church supper that she could make seven kinds of fancy bread but marie could make a dozen mrs lee held up one of the apricot rolls between her brown thumb and forefinger and weighed it critically yust likea fedders she pronounced with satisfaction my aant dis nice she exclaimed as she stirred her coffee i yust taake a liddle yelly now too i taank alexandra and marie laughed at her forehandedness and fell to talking of their own affairs i was afraid you had a cold when i talked to you over the telephone the other night marie what was the matter had you been crying maybe i had marie smiled guiltily frank was out late that night dont you get lonely sometimes in the winter when everybody has gone away i thought it was something like that if i hadnt had company id have run over to see for myself if you get downhearted what will become of the rest of us alexandra asked i dont very often theres mrs lee without any coffee later when mrs lee declared that her powers were spent marie and alexandra went upstairs to look for some crochet patterns the old lady wanted to borrow better put on your coat alexandra its cold up there and i have no idea where those patterns are i may have to look through my old trunks marie caught up a shawl and opened the stair door running up the steps ahead of her guest while i go through the bureau drawers you might look in those hatboxes on the closetshelf over where franks clothes hang there are a lot of odds and ends in them she began tossing over the contents of the drawers and alexandra went into the clothescloset presently she came back holding a slender elastic yellow stick in her hand what in the world is this marie you dont mean to tell me frank ever carried such a thing marie blinked at it with astonishment and sat down on the floor where did you find it i didnt know he had kept it i havent seen it for years it really is a cane then yes one he brought from the old country he used to carry it when i first knew him isnt it foolish poor frank alexandra twirled the stick in her fingers and laughed he must have looked funny marie was thoughtful no he didnt really it didnt seem out of place he used to be awfully gay like that when he was a young man i guess people always get whats hardest for them alexandra marie gathered the shawl closer about her and still looked hard at the cane frank would be all right in the right place she said reflectively he ought to have a different kind of wife for one thing do you know alexandra i could pick out exactly the right sort of woman for franknow the trouble is you almost have to marry a man before you can find out the sort of wife he needs and usually its exactly the sort you are not then what are you going to do about it she asked candidly alexandra confessed she didnt know however she added it seems to me that you get along with frank about as well as any woman ive ever seen or heard of could marie shook her head pursing her lips and blowing her warm breath softly out into the frosty air no i was spoiled at home i like my own way and i have a quick tongue when frank brags i say sharp things and he never forgets he goes over and over it in his mind i can feel him then im too giddy franks wife ought to be timid and she ought not to care about another living thing in the world but just frank i didnt when i married him but i suppose i was too young to stay like that marie sighed alexandra had never heard marie speak so frankly about her husband before and she felt that it was wiser not to encourage her no good she reasoned ever came from talking about such things and while marie was thinking aloud alexandra had been steadily searching the hatboxes arent these the patterns maria maria sprang up from the floor sure enough we were looking for patterns werent we id forgot about everything but franks other wife ill put that away she poked the cane behind franks sunday clothes and though she laughed alexandra saw there were tears in her eyes when they went back to the kitchen the snow had begun to fall and maries visitors thought they must be getting home she went out to the cart with them and tucked the robes about old mrs lee while alexandra took the blanket off her horse as they drove away marie turned and went slowly back to the house she took up the package of letters alexandra had brought but she did not read them she turned them over and looked at the foreign stamps and then sat watching the flying snow while the dusk deepened in the kitchen and the stove sent out a red glow marie knew perfectly well that emils letters were written more for her than for alexandra they were not the sort of letters that a young man writes to his sister they were both more personal and more painstaking full of descriptions of the gay life in the old mexican capital in the days when the strong hand of porfirio diaz was still strong he told about bullfights and cockfights churches and fiestas the flowermarkets and the fountains the music and dancing the people of all nations he met in the italian restaurants on san francisco street in short they were the kind of letters a young man writes to a woman when he wishes himself and his life to seem interesting to her when he wishes to enlist her imagination in his behalf marie when she was alone or when she sat sewing in the evening often thought about what it must be like down there where emil was where there were flowers and street bands everywhere and carriages rattling up and down and where there was a little blind bootblack in front of the cathedral who could play any tune you asked for by dropping the lids of blackingboxes on the stone steps when everything is done and over for one at twentythree it is pleasant to let the mind wander forth and follow a young adventurer who has life before him and if it had not been for me she thought frank might still be free like that and having a good time making people admire him poor frank getting married wasnt very good for him either im afraid i do set people against him as he says i seem somehow to give him away all the time perhaps he would try to be agreeable to people again if i were not around it seems as if i always make him just as bad as he can be later in the winter alexandra looked back upon that afternoon as the last satisfactory visit she had had with marie after that day the younger woman seemed to shrink more and more into herself when she was with alexandra she was not spontaneous and frank as she used to be she seemed to be brooding over something and holding something back the weather had a good deal to do with their seeing less of each other than usual there had not been such snowstorms in twenty years and the path across the fields was drifted deep from christmas until march when the two neighbors went to see each other they had to go round by the wagonroad which was twice as far they telephoned each other almost every night though in january there was a stretch of three weeks when the wires were down and when the postman did not come at all marie often ran in to see her nearest neighbor old mrs hiller who was crippled with rheumatism and had only her son the lame shoemaker to take care of her and she went to the french church whatever the weather she was a sincerely devout girl she prayed for herself and for frank and for emil among the temptations of that gay corrupt old city she found more comfort in the church that winter than ever before it seemed to come closer to her and to fill an emptiness that ached in her heart she tried to be patient with her husband he and his hired man usually played california jack in the evening marie sat sewing or crocheting and tried to take a friendly interest in the game but she was always thinking about the wide fields outside where the snow was drifting over the fences and about the orchard where the snow was falling and packing crust over crust when she went out into the dark kitchen to fix her plants for the night she used to stand by the window and look out at the white fields or watch the currents of snow whirling over the orchard she seemed to feel the weight of all the snow that lay down there the branches had become so hard that they wounded your hand if you but tried to break a twig and yet down under the frozen crusts at the roots of the trees the secret of life was still safe warm as the blood in ones heart and the spring would come again oh it would come again ii if alexandra had had much imagination she might have guessed what was going on in maries mind and she would have seen long before what was going on in emils but that as emil himself had more than once reflected was alexandras blind side and her life had not been of the kind to sharpen her vision her training had all been toward the end of making her proficient in what she had undertaken to do her personal life her own realization of herself was almost a subconscious existence like an underground river that came to the surface only here and there at intervals months apart and then sank again to flow on under her own fields nevertheless the underground stream was there and it was because she had so much personality to put into her enterprises and succeeded in putting it into them so completely that her affairs prospered better than those of her neighbors there were certain days in her life outwardly uneventful which alexandra remembered as peculiarly happy days when she was close to the flat fallow world about her and felt as it were in her own body the joyous germination in the soil there were days too which she and emil had spent together upon which she loved to look back there had been such a day when they were down on the river in the dry year looking over the land they had made an early start one morning and had driven a long way before noon when emil said he was hungry they drew back from the road gave brigham his oats among the bushes and climbed up to the top of a grassy bluff to eat their lunch under the shade of some little elm trees the river was clear there and shallow since there had been no rain and it ran in ripples over the sparkling sand under the overhanging willows of the opposite bank there was an inlet where the water was deeper and flowed so slowly that it seemed to sleep in the sun in this little bay a single wild duck was swimming and diving and preening her feathers disporting herself very happily in the flickering light and shade they sat for a long time watching the solitary bird take its pleasure no living thing had ever seemed to alexandra as beautiful as that wild duck emil must have felt about it as she did for afterward when they were at home he used sometimes to say sister you know our duck down there alexandra remembered that day as one of the happiest in her life years afterward she thought of the duck as still there swimming and diving all by herself in the sunlight a kind of enchanted bird that did not know age or change most of alexandras happy memories were as impersonal as this one yet to her they were very personal her mind was a white book with clear writing about weather and beasts and growing things not many people would have cared to read it only a happy few she had never been in love she had never indulged in sentimental reveries even as a girl she had looked upon men as workfellows she had grown up in serious times there was one fancy indeed which persisted through her girlhood it most often came to her on sunday mornings the one day in the week when she lay late abed listening to the familiar morning sounds the windmill singing in the brisk breeze emil whistling as he blacked his boots down by the kitchen door sometimes as she lay thus luxuriously idle her eyes closed she used to have an illusion of being lifted up bodily and carried lightly by some one very strong it was a man certainly who carried her but he was like no man she knew he was much larger and stronger and swifter and he carried her as easily as if she were a sheaf of wheat she never saw him but with eyes closed she could feel that he was yellow like the sunlight and there was the smell of ripe cornfields about him she could feel him approach bend over her and lift her and then she could feel herself being carried swiftly off across the fields after such a reverie she would rise hastily angry with herself and go down to the bathhouse that was partitioned off the kitchen shed there she would stand in a tin tub and prosecute her bath with vigor finishing it by pouring buckets of cold wellwater over her gleaming white body which no man on the divide could have carried very far as she grew older this fancy more often came to her when she was tired than when she was fresh and strong sometimes after she had been in the open all day overseeing the branding of the cattle or the loading of the pigs she would come in chilled take a concoction of spices and warm homemade wine and go to bed with her body actually aching with fatigue then just before she went to sleep she had the old sensation of being lifted and carried by a strong being who took from her all her bodily weariness part iv the white mulberry tree i the french church properly the church of sainteagnes stood upon a hill the high narrow redbrick building with its tall steeple and steep roof could be seen for miles across the wheatfields though the little town of sainteagnes was completely hidden away at the foot of the hill the church looked powerful and triumphant there on its eminence so high above the rest of the landscape with miles of warm color lying at its feet and by its position and setting it reminded one of some of the churches built long ago in the wheatlands of middle france late one june afternoon alexandra bergson was driving along one of the many roads that led through the rich french farming country to the big church the sunlight was shining directly in her face and there was a blaze of light all about the red church on the hill beside alexandra lounged a strikingly exotic figure in a tall mexican hat a silk sash and a black velvet jacket sewn with silver buttons emil had returned only the night before and his sister was so proud of him that she decided at once to take him up to the church supper and to make him wear the mexican costume he had brought home in his trunk all the girls who have stands are going to wear fancy costumes she argued and some of the boys marie is going to tell fortunes and she sent to omaha for a bohemian dress her father brought back from a visit to the old country if you wear those clothes they will all be pleased and you must take your guitar everybody ought to do what they can to help along and we have never done much we are not a talented family the supper was to be at six oclock in the basement of the church and afterward there would be a fair with charades and an auction alexandra had set out from home early leaving the house to signa and nelse jensen who were to be married next week signa had shyly asked to have the wedding put off until emil came home alexandra was well satisfied with her brother as they drove through the rolling french country toward the westering sun and the stalwart church she was thinking of that time long ago when she and emil drove back from the river valley to the still unconquered divide yes she told herself it had been worth while both emil and the country had become what she had hoped out of her fathers children there was one who was fit to cope with the world who had not been tied to the plow and who had a personality apart from the soil and that she reflected was what she had worked for she felt well satisfied with her life when they reached the church a score of teams were hitched in front of the basement doors that opened from the hillside upon the sanded terrace where the boys wrestled and had jumpingmatches amedee chevalier a proud father of one week rushed out and embraced emil amedee was an only sonhence he was a very rich young manbut he meant to have twenty children himself like his uncle xavier oh emil he cried hugging his old friend rapturously why aint you been up to see my boy you come tomorrow sure emil you wanna get a boy right off its the greatest thing ever no no no angel not sick at all everything just fine that boy he come into this world laughin and he been laughin ever since you come an see he pounded emils ribs to emphasize each announcement emil caught his arms stop amedee youre knocking the wind out of me i brought him cups and spoons and blankets and moccasins enough for an orphan asylum im awful glad its a boy sure enough the young men crowded round emil to admire his costume and to tell him in a breath everything that had happened since he went away emil had more friends up here in the french country than down on norway creek the french and bohemian boys were spirited and jolly liked variety and were as much predisposed to favor anything new as the scandinavian boys were to reject it the norwegian and swedish lads were much more selfcentred apt to be egotistical and jealous they were cautious and reserved with emil because he had been away to college and were prepared to take him down if he should try to put on airs with them the french boys liked a bit of swagger and they were always delighted to hear about anything new new clothes new games new songs new dances now they carried emil off to show him the club room they had just fitted up over the postoffice down in the village they ran down the hill in a drove all laughing and chattering at once some in french some in english alexandra went into the cool whitewashed basement where the women were setting the tables marie was standing on a chair building a little tent of shawls where she was to tell fortunes she sprang down and ran toward alexandra stopping short and looking at her in disappointment alexandra nodded to her encouragingly oh he will be here marie the boys have taken him off to show him something you wont know him he is a man now sure enough i have no boy left he smokes terriblesmelling mexican cigarettes and talks spanish how pretty you look child where did you get those beautiful earrings they belonged to fathers mother he always promised them to me he sent them with the dress and said i could keep them marie wore a short red skirt of stoutly woven cloth a white bodice and kirtle a yellow silk turban wound low over her brown curls and long coral pendants in her ears her ears had been pierced against a piece of cork by her greataunt when she was seven years old in those germless days she had worn bits of broomstraw plucked from the common sweepingbroom in the lobes until the holes were healed and ready for little gold rings when emil came back from the village he lingered outside on the terrace with the boys marie could hear him talking and strumming on his guitar while raoul marcel sang falsetto she was vexed with him for staying out there it made her very nervous to hear him and not to see him for certainly she told herself she was not going out to look for him when the supper bell rang and the boys came trooping in to get seats at the first table she forgot all about her annoyance and ran to greet the tallest of the crowd in his conspicuous attire she didnt mind showing her embarrassment at all she blushed and laughed excitedly as she gave emil her hand and looked delightedly at the black velvet coat that brought out his fair skin and fine blond head marie was incapable of being lukewarm about anything that pleased her she simply did not know how to give a halfhearted response when she was delighted she was as likely as not to stand on her tiptoes and clap her hands if people laughed at her she laughed with them do the men wear clothes like that every day in the street she caught emil by his sleeve and turned him about oh i wish i lived where people wore things like that are the buttons real silver put on the hat please what a heavy thing how do you ever wear it why dont you tell us about the bullfights she wanted to wring all his experiences from him at once without waiting a moment emil smiled tolerantly and stood looking down at her with his old brooding gaze while the french girls fluttered about him in their white dresses and ribbons and alexandra watched the scene with pride several of the french girls marie knew were hoping that emil would take them to supper and she was relieved when he took only his sister marie caught franks arm and dragged him to the same table managing to get seats opposite the bergsons so that she could hear what they were talking about alexandra made emil tell mrs xavier chevalier the mother of the twenty about how he had seen a famous matador killed in the bullring marie listened to every word only taking her eyes from emil to watch franks plate and keep it filled when emil finished his accountbloody enough to satisfy mrs xavier and to make her feel thankful that she was not a matadormarie broke out with a volley of questions how did the women dress when they went to bullfights did they wear mantillas did they never wear hats after supper the young people played charades for the amusement of their elders who sat gossiping between their guesses all the shops in sainteagnes were closed at eight oclock that night so that the merchants and their clerks could attend the fair the auction was the liveliest part of the entertainment for the french boys always lost their heads when they began to bid satisfied that their extravagance was in a good cause after all the pincushions and sofa pillows and embroidered slippers were sold emil precipitated a panic by taking out one of his turquoise shirt studs which every one had been admiring and handing it to the auctioneer all the french girls clamored for it and their sweethearts bid against each other recklessly marie wanted it too and she kept making signals to frank which he took a sour pleasure in disregarding he didnt see the use of making a fuss over a fellow just because he was dressed like a clown when the turquoise went to malvina sauvage the french bankers daughter marie shrugged her shoulders and betook herself to her little tent of shawls where she began to shuffle her cards by the light of a tallow candle calling out fortunes fortunes the young priest father duchesne went first to have his fortune read marie took his long white hand looked at it and then began to run off her cards i see a long journey across water for you father you will go to a town all cut up by water built on islands it seems to be with rivers and green fields all about and you will visit an old lady with a white cap and gold hoops in her ears and you will be very happy there mais oui said the priest with a melancholy smile cest lisleadam chez ma mere vous etes tres savante ma fille he patted her yellow turban calling venez donc mes garcons il y a ici une veritable clairvoyante marie was clever at fortunetelling indulging in a light irony that amused the crowd she told old brunot the miser that he would lose all his money marry a girl of sixteen and live happily on a crust sholte the fat russian boy who lived for his stomach was to be disappointed in love grow thin and shoot himself from despondency amedee was to have twenty children and nineteen of them were to be girls amedee slapped frank on the back and asked him why he didnt see what the fortuneteller would promise him but frank shook off his friendly hand and grunted she tell my fortune long ago bad enough then he withdrew to a corner and sat glowering at his wife franks case was all the more painful because he had no one in particular to fix his jealousy upon sometimes he could have thanked the man who would bring him evidence against his wife he had discharged a good farmboy jan smirka because he thought marie was fond of him but she had not seemed to miss jan when he was gone and she had been just as kind to the next boy the farmhands would always do anything for marie frank couldnt find one so surly that he would not make an effort to please her at the bottom of his heart frank knew well enough that if he could once give up his grudge his wife would come back to him but he could never in the world do that the grudge was fundamental perhaps he could not have given it up if he had tried perhaps he got more satisfaction out of feeling himself abused than he would have got out of being loved if he could once have made marie thoroughly unhappy he might have relented and raised her from the dust but she had never humbled herself in the first days of their love she had been his slave she had admired him abandonedly but the moment he began to bully her and to be unjust she began to draw away at first in tearful amazement then in quiet unspoken disgust the distance between them had widened and hardened it no longer contracted and brought them suddenly together the spark of her life went somewhere else and he was always watching to surprise it he knew that somewhere she must get a feeling to live upon for she was not a woman who could live without loving he wanted to prove to himself the wrong he felt what did she hide in her heart where did it go even frank had his churlish delicacies he never reminded her of how much she had once loved him for that marie was grateful to him while marie was chattering to the french boys amedee called emil to the back of the room and whispered to him that they were going to play a joke on the girls at eleven oclock amedee was to go up to the switchboard in the vestibule and turn off the electric lights and every boy would have a chance to kiss his sweetheart before father duchesne could find his way up the stairs to turn the current on again the only difficulty was the candle in maries tent perhaps as emil had no sweetheart he would oblige the boys by blowing out the candle emil said he would undertake to do that at five minutes to eleven he sauntered up to maries booth and the french boys dispersed to find their girls he leaned over the cardtable and gave himself up to looking at her do you think you could tell my fortune he murmured it was the first word he had had alone with her for almost a year my luck hasnt changed any its just the same marie had often wondered whether there was anyone else who could look his thoughts to you as emil could tonight when she met his steady powerful eyes it was impossible not to feel the sweetness of the dream he was dreaming it reached her before she could shut it out and hid itself in her heart she began to shuffle her cards furiously im angry with you emil she broke out with petulance why did you give them that lovely blue stone to sell you might have known frank wouldnt buy it for me and i wanted it awfully emil laughed shortly people who want such little things surely ought to have them he said dryly he thrust his hand into the pocket of his velvet trousers and brought out a handful of uncut turquoises as big as marbles leaning over the table he dropped them into her lap there will those do be careful dont let any one see them now i suppose you want me to go away and let you play with them marie was gazing in rapture at the soft blue color of the stones oh emil is everything down there beautiful like these how could you ever come away at that instant amedee laid hands on the switchboard there was a shiver and a giggle and every one looked toward the red blur that maries candle made in the dark immediately that too was gone little shrieks and currents of soft laughter ran up and down the dark hall marie started updirectly into emils arms in the same instant she felt his lips the veil that had hung uncertainly between them for so long was dissolved before she knew what she was doing she had committed herself to that kiss that was at once a boys and a mans as timid as it was tender so like emil and so unlike any one else in the world not until it was over did she realize what it meant and emil who had so often imagined the shock of this first kiss was surprised at its gentleness and naturalness it was like a sigh which they had breathed together almost sorrowful as if each were afraid of wakening something in the other when the lights came on again everybody was laughing and shouting and all the french girls were rosy and shining with mirth only marie in her little tent of shawls was pale and quiet under her yellow turban the red coral pendants swung against white cheeks frank was still staring at her but he seemed to see nothing years ago he himself had had the power to take the blood from her cheeks like that perhaps he did not rememberperhaps he had never noticed emil was already at the other end of the hall walking about with the shouldermotion he had acquired among the mexicans studying the floor with his intent deepset eyes marie began to take down and fold her shawls she did not glance up again the young people drifted to the other end of the hall where the guitar was sounding in a moment she heard emil and raoul singing across the rio grande there lies a sunny lande my brighteyed mexico alexandra bergson came up to the card booth let me help you marie you look tired she placed her hand on maries arm and felt her shiver marie stiffened under that kind calm hand alexandra drew back perplexed and hurt there was about alexandra something of the impervious calm of the fatalist always disconcerting to very young people who cannot feel that the heart lives at all unless it is still at the mercy of storms unless its strings can scream to the touch of pain ii signas wedding supper was over the guests and the tiresome little norwegian preacher who had performed the marriage ceremony were saying goodnight old ivar was hitching the horses to the wagon to take the wedding presents and the bride and groom up to their new home on alexandras north quarter when ivar drove up to the gate emil and marie shabata began to carry out the presents and alexandra went into her bedroom to bid signa goodbye and to give her a few words of good counsel she was surprised to find that the bride had changed her slippers for heavy shoes and was pinning up her skirts at that moment nelse appeared at the gate with the two milk cows that alexandra had given signa for a wedding present alexandra began to laugh why signa you and nelse are to ride home ill send ivar over with the cows in the morning signa hesitated and looked perplexed when her husband called her she pinned her hat on resolutely i taank i better do yust like he say she murmured in confusion alexandra and marie accompanied signa to the gate and saw the party set off old ivar driving ahead in the wagon and the bride and groom following on foot each leading a cow emil burst into a laugh before they were out of hearing those two will get on said alexandra as they turned back to the house they are not going to take any chances they will feel safer with those cows in their own stable marie i am going to send for an old woman next as soon as i get the girls broken in i marry them off ive no patience with signa marrying that grumpy fellow marie declared i wanted her to marry that nice smirka boy who worked for us last winter i think she liked him too yes i think she did alexandra assented but i suppose she was too much afraid of nelse to marry any one else now that i think of it most of my girls have married men they were afraid of i believe there is a good deal of the cow in most swedish girls you highstrung bohemian cant understand us were a terribly practical people and i guess we think a cross man makes a good manager marie shrugged her shoulders and turned to pin up a lock of hair that had fallen on her neck somehow alexandra had irritated her of late everybody irritated her she was tired of everybody im going home alone emil so you neednt get your hat she said as she wound her scarf quickly about her head goodnight alexandra she called back in a strained voice running down the gravel walk emil followed with long strides until he overtook her then she began to walk slowly it was a night of warm wind and faint starlight and the fireflies were glimmering over the wheat marie said emil after they had walked for a while i wonder if you know how unhappy i am marie did not answer him her head in its white scarf drooped forward a little emil kicked a clod from the path and went on i wonder whether you are really shallowhearted like you seem sometimes i think one boy does just as well as another for you it never seems to make much difference whether it is me or raoul marcel or jan smirka are you really like that perhaps i am what do you want me to do sit round and cry all day when ive cried until i cant cry any more thenthen i must do something else are you sorry for me he persisted no im not if i were big and free like you i wouldnt let anything make me unhappy as old napoleon brunot said at the fair i wouldnt go lovering after no woman id take the first train and go off and have all the fun there is i tried that but it didnt do any good everything reminded me the nicer the place was the more i wanted you they had come to the stile and emil pointed to it persuasively sit down a moment i want to ask you something marie sat down on the top step and emil drew nearer would you tell me something thats none of my business if you thought it would help me out well then tell me please tell me why you ran away with frank shabata marie drew back because i was in love with him she said firmly really he asked incredulously yes indeed very much in love with him i think i was the one who suggested our running away from the first it was more my fault than his emil turned away his face and now marie went on ive got to remember that frank is just the same now as he was then only then i would see him as i wanted him to be i would have my own way and now i pay for it you dont do all the paying thats it when one makes a mistake theres no telling where it will stop but you can go away you can leave all this behind you not everything i cant leave you behind will you go away with me marie marie started up and stepped across the stile emil how wickedly you talk i am not that kind of a girl and you know it but what am i going to do if you keep tormenting me like this she added plaintively marie i wont bother you any more if you will tell me just one thing stop a minute and look at me no nobody can see us everybodys asleep that was only a firefly marie stop and tell me emil overtook her and catching her by the shoulders shook her gently as if he were trying to awaken a sleepwalker marie hid her face on his arm dont ask me anything more i dont know anything except how miserable i am and i thought it would be all right when you came back oh emil she clutched his sleeve and began to cry what am i to do if you dont go away i cant go and one of us must cant you see emil stood looking down at her holding his shoulders stiff and stiffening the arm to which she clung her white dress looked gray in the darkness she seemed like a troubled spirit like some shadow out of the earth clinging to him and entreating him to give her peace behind her the fireflies were weaving in and out over the wheat he put his hand on her bent head on my honor marie if you will say you love me i will go away she lifted her face to his how could i help it didnt you know emil was the one who trembled through all his frame after he left marie at her gate he wandered about the fields all night till morning put out the fireflies and the stars iii one evening a week after signas wedding emil was kneeling before a box in the sittingroom packing his books from time to time he rose and wandered about the house picking up stray volumes and bringing them listlessly back to his box he was packing without enthusiasm he was not very sanguine about his future alexandra sat sewing by the table she had helped him pack his trunk in the afternoon as emil came and went by her chair with his books he thought to himself that it had not been so hard to leave his sister since he first went away to school he was going directly to omaha to read law in the office of a swedish lawyer until october when he would enter the law school at ann arbor they had planned that alexandra was to come to michigana long journey for herat christmas time and spend several weeks with him nevertheless he felt that this leavetaking would be more final than his earlier ones had been that it meant a definite break with his old home and the beginning of something newhe did not know what his ideas about the future would not crystallize the more he tried to think about it the vaguer his conception of it became but one thing was clear he told himself it was high time that he made good to alexandra and that ought to be incentive enough to begin with as he went about gathering up his books he felt as if he were uprooting things at last he threw himself down on the old slat lounge where he had slept when he was little and lay looking up at the familiar cracks in the ceiling tired emil his sister asked lazy he murmured turning on his side and looking at her he studied alexandras face for a long time in the lamplight it had never occurred to him that his sister was a handsome woman until marie shabata had told him so indeed he had never thought of her as being a woman at all only a sister as he studied her bent head he looked up at the picture of john bergson above the lamp no he thought to himself she didnt get it there i suppose i am more like that alexandra he said suddenly that old walnut secretary you use for a desk was fathers wasnt it alexandra went on stitching yes it was one of the first things he bought for the old log house it was a great extravagance in those days but he wrote a great many letters back to the old country he had many friends there and they wrote to him up to the time he died no one ever blamed him for grandfathers disgrace i can see him now sitting there on sundays in his white shirt writing pages and pages so carefully he wrote a fine regular hand almost like engraving yours is something like his when you take pains grandfather was really crooked was he he married an unscrupulous woman and thenthen im afraid he was really crooked when we first came here father used to have dreams about making a great fortune and going back to sweden to pay back to the poor sailors the money grandfather had lost emil stirred on the lounge i say that would have been worth while wouldnt it father wasnt a bit like lou or oscar was he i cant remember much about him before he got sick oh not at all alexandra dropped her sewing on her knee he had better opportunities not to make money but to make something of himself he was a quiet man but he was very intelligent you would have been proud of him emil alexandra felt that he would like to know there had been a man of his kin whom he could admire she knew that emil was ashamed of lou and oscar because they were bigoted and selfsatisfied he never said much about them but she could feel his disgust his brothers had shown their disapproval of him ever since he first went away to school the only thing that would have satisfied them would have been his failure at the university as it was they resented every change in his speech in his dress in his point of view though the latter they had to conjecture for emil avoided talking to them about any but family matters all his interests they treated as affectations alexandra took up her sewing again i can remember father when he was quite a young man he belonged to some kind of a musical society a male chorus in stockholm i can remember going with mother to hear them sing there must have been a hundred of them and they all wore long black coats and white neckties i was used to seeing father in a blue coat a sort of jacket and when i recognized him on the platform i was very proud do you remember that swedish song he taught you about the ship boy yes i used to sing it to the mexicans they like anything different emil paused father had a hard fight here didnt he he added thoughtfully yes and he died in a dark time still he had hope he believed in the land and in you i guess emil said to himself there was another period of silence that warm friendly silence full of perfect understanding in which emil and alexandra had spent many of their happiest halfhours at last emil said abruptly lou and oscar would be better off if they were poor wouldnt they alexandra smiled maybe but their children wouldnt i have great hopes of milly emil shivered i dont know seems to me it gets worse as it goes on the worst of the swedes is that theyre never willing to find out how much they dont know it was like that at the university always so pleased with themselves theres no getting behind that conceited swedish grin the bohemians and germans were so different come emil dont go back on your own people father wasnt conceited uncle otto wasnt even lou and oscar werent when they were boys emil looked incredulous but he did not dispute the point he turned on his back and lay still for a long time his hands locked under his head looking up at the ceiling alexandra knew that he was thinking of many things she felt no anxiety about emil she had always believed in him as she had believed in the land he had been more like himself since he got back from mexico seemed glad to be at home and talked to her as he used to do she had no doubt that his wandering fit was over and that he would soon be settled in life alexandra said emil suddenly do you remember the wild duck we saw down on the river that time his sister looked up i often think of her it always seems to me shes there still just like we saw her i know its queer what things one remembers and what things one forgets emil yawned and sat up well its time to turn in he rose and going over to alexandra stooped down and kissed her lightly on the cheek goodnight sister i think you did pretty well by us emil took up his lamp and went upstairs alexandra sat finishing his new nightshirt that must go in the top tray of his trunk iv the next morning angelique amedees wife was in the kitchen baking pies assisted by old mrs chevalier between the mixingboard and the stove stood the old cradle that had been amedees and in it was his blackeyed son as angelique flushed and excited with flour on her hands stopped to smile at the baby emil bergson rode up to the kitchen door on his mare and dismounted medee is out in the field emil angelique called as she ran across the kitchen to the oven he begins to cut his wheat today the first wheat ready to cut anywhere about here he bought a new header you know because all the wheats so short this year i hope he can rent it to the neighbors it cost so much he and his cousins bought a steam thresher on shares you ought to go out and see that header work i watched it an hour this morning busy as i am with all the men to feed he has a lot of hands but hes the only one that knows how to drive the header or how to run the engine so he has to be everywhere at once hes sick too and ought to be in his bed emil bent over hector baptiste trying to make him blink his round beadlike black eyes sick whats the matter with your daddy kid been making him walk the floor with you angelique sniffed not much we dont have that kind of babies it was his father that kept baptiste awake all night i had to be getting up and making mustard plasters to put on his stomach he had an awful colic he said he felt better this morning but i dont think he ought to be out in the field overheating himself angelique did not speak with much anxiety not because she was indifferent but because she felt so secure in their good fortune only good things could happen to a rich energetic handsome young man like amedee with a new baby in the cradle and a new header in the field emil stroked the black fuzz on baptistes head i say angelique one of medees grandmothers way back must have been a squaw this kid looks exactly like the indian babies angelique made a face at him but old mrs chevalier had been touched on a sore point and she let out such a stream of fiery patois that emil fled from the kitchen and mounted his mare opening the pasture gate from the saddle emil rode across the field to the clearing where the thresher stood driven by a stationary engine and fed from the header boxes as amedee was not on the engine emil rode on to the wheatfield where he recognized on the header the slight wiry figure of his friend coatless his white shirt puffed out by the wind his straw hat stuck jauntily on the side of his head the six big workhorses that drew or rather pushed the header went abreast at a rapid walk and as they were still green at the work they required a good deal of management on amedees part especially when they turned the corners where they divided three and three and then swung round into line again with a movement that looked as complicated as a wheel of artillery emil felt a new thrill of admiration for his friend and with it the old pang of envy at the way in which amedee could do with his might what his hand found to do and feel that whatever it was it was the most important thing in the world ill have to bring alexandra up to see this thing work emil thought its splendid when he saw emil amedee waved to him and called to one of his twenty cousins to take the reins stepping off the header without stopping it he ran up to emil who had dismounted come along he called i have to go over to the engine for a minute i gotta green man running it and i gotta to keep an eye on him emil thought the lad was unnaturally flushed and more excited than even the cares of managing a big farm at a critical time warranted as they passed behind a last years stack amedee clutched at his right side and sank down for a moment on the straw ouch i got an awful pain in me emil somethings the matter with my insides for sure emil felt his fiery cheek you ought to go straight to bed medee and telephone for the doctor thats what you ought to do amedee staggered up with a gesture of despair how can i i got no time to be sick three thousand dollars worth of new machinery to manage and the wheat so ripe it will begin to shatter next week my wheats short but its gotta grand full berries whats he slowing down for we havent got header boxes enough to feed the thresher i guess amedee started hotfoot across the stubble leaning a little to the right as he ran and waved to the engineer not to stop the engine emil saw that this was no time to talk about his own affairs he mounted his mare and rode on to sainteagnes to bid his friends there goodbye he went first to see raoul marcel and found him innocently practising the gloria for the big confirmation service on sunday while he polished the mirrors of his fathers saloon as emil rode homewards at three oclock in the afternoon he saw amedee staggering out of the wheatfield supported by two of his cousins emil stopped and helped them put the boy to bed v when frank shabata came in from work at five oclock that evening old moses marcel raouls father telephoned him that amedee had had a seizure in the wheatfield and that doctor paradis was going to operate on him as soon as the hanover doctor got there to help frank dropped a word of this at the table bolted his supper and rode off to sainteagnes where there would be sympathetic discussion of amedees case at marcels saloon as soon as frank was gone marie telephoned alexandra it was a comfort to hear her friends voice yes alexandra knew what there was to be known about amedee emil had been there when they carried him out of the field and had stayed with him until the doctors operated for appendicitis at five oclock they were afraid it was too late to do much good it should have been done three days ago amedee was in a very bad way emil had just come home worn out and sick himself she had given him some brandy and put him to bed marie hung up the receiver poor amedees illness had taken on a new meaning to her now that she knew emil had been with him and it might so easily have been the other wayemil who was ill and amedee who was sad marie looked about the dusky sittingroom she had seldom felt so utterly lonely if emil was asleep there was not even a chance of his coming and she could not go to alexandra for sympathy she meant to tell alexandra everything as soon as emil went away then whatever was left between them would be honest but she could not stay in the house this evening where should she go she walked slowly down through the orchard where the evening air was heavy with the smell of wild cotton the fresh salty scent of the wild roses had given way before this more powerful perfume of midsummer wherever those ashesofrose balls hung on their milky stalks the air about them was saturated with their breath the sky was still red in the west and the evening star hung directly over the bergsons windmill marie crossed the fence at the wheatfield corner and walked slowly along the path that led to alexandras she could not help feeling hurt that emil had not come to tell her about amedee it seemed to her most unnatural that he should not have come if she were in trouble certainly he was the one person in the world she would want to see perhaps he wished her to understand that for her he was as good as gone already marie stole slowly flutteringly along the path like a white nightmoth out of the fields the years seemed to stretch before her like the land spring summer autumn winter spring always the same patient fields the patient little trees the patient lives always the same yearning the same pulling at the chainuntil the instinct to live had torn itself and bled and weakened for the last time until the chain secured a dead woman who might cautiously be released marie walked on her face lifted toward the remote inaccessible evening star when she reached the stile she sat down and waited how terrible it was to love people when you could not really share their lives yes in so far as she was concerned emil was already gone they couldnt meet any more there was nothing for them to say they had spent the last penny of their small change there was nothing left but gold the day of lovetokens was past they had now only their hearts to give each other and emil being gone what was her life to be like in some ways it would be easier she would not at least live in perpetual fear if emil were once away and settled at work she would not have the feeling that she was spoiling his life with the memory he left her she could be as rash as she chose nobody could be the worse for it but herself and that surely did not matter her own case was clear when a girl had loved one man and then loved another while that man was still alive everybody knew what to think of her what happened to her was of little consequence so long as she did not drag other people down with her emil once away she could let everything else go and live a new life of perfect love marie left the stile reluctantly she had after all thought he might come and how glad she ought to be she told herself that he was asleep she left the path and went across the pasture the moon was almost full an owl was hooting somewhere in the fields she had scarcely thought about where she was going when the pond glittered before her where emil had shot the ducks she stopped and looked at it yes there would be a dirty way out of life if one chose to take it but she did not want to die she wanted to live and dreama hundred years forever as long as this sweetness welled up in her heart as long as her breast could hold this treasure of pain she felt as the pond must feel when it held the moon like that when it encircled and swelled with that image of gold in the morning when emil came downstairs alexandra met him in the sittingroom and put her hands on his shoulders emil i went to your room as soon as it was light but you were sleeping so sound i hated to wake you there was nothing you could do so i let you sleep they telephoned from sainteagnes that amedee died at three oclock this morning vi the church has always held that life is for the living on saturday while half the village of sainteagnes was mourning for amedee and preparing the funeral black for his burial on monday the other half was busy with white dresses and white veils for the great confirmation service tomorrow when the bishop was to confirm a class of one hundred boys and girls father duchesne divided his time between the living and the dead all day saturday the church was a scene of bustling activity a little hushed by the thought of amedee the choir were busy rehearsing a mass of rossini which they had studied and practised for this occasion the women were trimming the altar the boys and girls were bringing flowers on sunday morning the bishop was to drive overland to sainteagnes from hanover and emil bergson had been asked to take the place of one of amedees cousins in the cavalcade of forty french boys who were to ride across country to meet the bishops carriage at six oclock on sunday morning the boys met at the church as they stood holding their horses by the bridle they talked in low tones of their dead comrade they kept repeating that amedee had always been a good boy glancing toward the red brick church which had played so large a part in amedees life had been the scene of his most serious moments and of his happiest hours he had played and wrestled and sung and courted under its shadow only three weeks ago he had proudly carried his baby there to be christened they could not doubt that that invisible arm was still about amedee that through the church on earth he had passed to the church triumphant the goal of the hopes and faith of so many hundred years when the word was given to mount the young men rode at a walk out of the village but once out among the wheatfields in the morning sun their horses and their own youth got the better of them a wave of zeal and fiery enthusiasm swept over them they longed for a jerusalem to deliver the thud of their galloping hoofs interrupted many a country breakfast and brought many a woman and child to the door of the farmhouses as they passed five miles east of sainteagnes they met the bishop in his open carriage attended by two priests like one man the boys swung off their hats in a broad salute and bowed their heads as the handsome old man lifted his two fingers in the episcopal blessing the horsemen closed about the carriage like a guard and whenever a restless horse broke from control and shot down the road ahead of the body the bishop laughed and rubbed his plump hands together what fine boys he said to his priests the church still has her cavalry as the troop swept past the graveyard half a mile east of the townthe first frame church of the parish had stood thereold pierre seguin was already out with his pick and spade digging amedees grave he knelt and uncovered as the bishop passed the boys with one accord looked away from old pierre to the red church on the hill with the gold cross flaming on its steeple mass was at eleven while the church was filling emil bergson waited outside watching the wagons and buggies drive up the hill after the bell began to ring he saw frank shabata ride up on horseback and tie his horse to the hitchbar marie then was not coming emil turned and went into the church amedees was the only empty pew and he sat down in it some of amedees cousins were there dressed in black and weeping when all the pews were full the old men and boys packed the open space at the back of the church kneeling on the floor there was scarcely a family in town that was not represented in the confirmation class by a cousin at least the new communicants with their clear reverent faces were beautiful to look upon as they entered in a body and took the front benches reserved for them even before the mass began the air was charged with feeling the choir had never sung so well and raoul marcel in the gloria drew even the bishops eyes to the organ loft for the offertory he sang gounods ave mariaalways spoken of in sainteagnes as the ave maria emil began to torture himself with questions about marie was she ill had she quarreled with her husband was she too unhappy to find comfort even here had she perhaps thought that he would come to her was she waiting for him overtaxed by excitement and sorrow as he was the rapture of the service took hold upon his body and mind as he listened to raoul he seemed to emerge from the conflicting emotions which had been whirling him about and sucking him under he felt as if a clear light broke upon his mind and with it a conviction that good was after all stronger than evil and that good was possible to men he seemed to discover that there was a kind of rapture in which he could love forever without faltering and without sin he looked across the heads of the people at frank shabata with calmness that rapture was for those who could feel it for people who could not it was nonexistent he coveted nothing that was frank shabatas the spirit he had met in music was his own frank shabata had never found it would never find it if he lived beside it a thousand years would have destroyed it if he had found it as herod slew the innocents as rome slew the martyrs sancta mariiia wailed raoul from the organ loft ora pro noobis and it did not occur to emil that any one had ever reasoned thus before that music had ever before given a man this equivocal revelation the confirmation service followed the mass when it was over the congregation thronged about the newly confirmed the girls and even the boys were kissed and embraced and wept over all the aunts and grandmothers wept with joy the housewives had much ado to tear themselves away from the general rejoicing and hurry back to their kitchens the country parishioners were staying in town for dinner and nearly every house in sainteagnes entertained visitors that day father duchesne the bishop and the visiting priests dined with fabien sauvage the banker emil and frank shabata were both guests of old moise marcel after dinner frank and old moise retired to the rear room of the saloon to play california jack and drink their cognac and emil went over to the bankers with raoul who had been asked to sing for the bishop at three oclock emil felt that he could stand it no longer he slipped out under cover of the holy city followed by malvinas wistful eye and went to the stable for his mare he was at that height of excitement from which everything is foreshortened from which life seems short and simple death very near and the soul seems to soar like an eagle as he rode past the graveyard he looked at the brown hole in the earth where amedee was to lie and felt no horror that too was beautiful that simple doorway into forgetfulness the heart when it is too much alive aches for that brown earth and ecstasy has no fear of death it is the old and the poor and the maimed who shrink from that brown hole its wooers are found among the young the passionate the gallanthearted it was not until he had passed the graveyard that emil realized where he was going it was the hour for saying goodbye it might be the last time that he would see her alone and today he could leave her without rancor without bitterness everywhere the grain stood ripe and the hot afternoon was full of the smell of the ripe wheat like the smell of bread baking in an oven the breath of the wheat and the sweet clover passed him like pleasant things in a dream he could feel nothing but the sense of diminishing distance it seemed to him that his mare was flying or running on wheels like a railway train the sunlight flashing on the windowglass of the big red barns drove him wild with joy he was like an arrow shot from the bow his life poured itself out along the road before him as he rode to the shabata farm when emil alighted at the shabatas gate his horse was in a lather he tied her in the stable and hurried to the house it was empty she might be at mrs hillers or with alexandra but anything that reminded him of her would be enough the orchard the mulberry tree when he reached the orchard the sun was hanging low over the wheatfield long fingers of light reached through the apple branches as through a net the orchard was riddled and shot with gold light was the reality the trees were merely interferences that reflected and refracted light emil went softly down between the cherry trees toward the wheatfield when he came to the corner he stopped short and put his hand over his mouth marie was lying on her side under the white mulberry tree her face half hidden in the grass her eyes closed her hands lying limply where they had happened to fall she had lived a day of her new life of perfect love and it had left her like this her breast rose and fell faintly as if she were asleep emil threw himself down beside her and took her in his arms the blood came back to her cheeks her amber eyes opened slowly and in them emil saw his own face and the orchard and the sun i was dreaming this she whispered hiding her face against him dont take my dream away vii when frank shabata got home that night he found emils mare in his stable such an impertinence amazed him like everybody else frank had had an exciting day since noon he had been drinking too much and he was in a bad temper he talked bitterly to himself while he put his own horse away and as he went up the path and saw that the house was dark he felt an added sense of injury he approached quietly and listened on the doorstep hearing nothing he opened the kitchen door and went softly from one room to another then he went through the house again upstairs and down with no better result he sat down on the bottom step of the box stairway and tried to get his wits together in that unnatural quiet there was no sound but his own heavy breathing suddenly an owl began to hoot out in the fields frank lifted his head an idea flashed into his mind and his sense of injury and outrage grew he went into his bedroom and took his murderous 405 winchester from the closet when frank took up his gun and walked out of the house he had not the faintest purpose of doing anything with it he did not believe that he had any real grievance but it gratified him to feel like a desperate man he had got into the habit of seeing himself always in desperate straits his unhappy temperament was like a cage he could never get out of it and he felt that other people his wife in particular must have put him there it had never more than dimly occurred to frank that he made his own unhappiness though he took up his gun with dark projects in his mind he would have been paralyzed with fright had he known that there was the slightest probability of his ever carrying any of them out frank went slowly down to the orchard gate stopped and stood for a moment lost in thought he retraced his steps and looked through the barn and the hayloft then he went out to the road where he took the footpath along the outside of the orchard hedge the hedge was twice as tall as frank himself and so dense that one could see through it only by peering closely between the leaves he could see the empty path a long way in the moonlight his mind traveled ahead to the stile which he always thought of as haunted by emil bergson but why had he left his horse at the wheatfield corner where the orchard hedge ended and the path led across the pasture to the bergsons frank stopped in the warm breathless night air he heard a murmuring sound perfectly inarticulate as low as the sound of water coming from a spring where there is no fall and where there are no stones to fret it frank strained his ears it ceased he held his breath and began to tremble resting the butt of his gun on the ground he parted the mulberry leaves softly with his fingers and peered through the hedge at the dark figures on the grass in the shadow of the mulberry tree it seemed to him that they must feel his eyes that they must hear him breathing but they did not frank who had always wanted to see things blacker than they were for once wanted to believe less than he saw the woman lying in the shadow might so easily be one of the bergsons farmgirls again the murmur like water welling out of the ground this time he heard it more distinctly and his blood was quicker than his brain he began to act just as a man who falls into the fire begins to act the gun sprang to his shoulder he sighted mechanically and fired three times without stopping stopped without knowing why either he shut his eyes or he had vertigo he did not see anything while he was firing he thought he heard a cry simultaneous with the second report but he was not sure he peered again through the hedge at the two dark figures under the tree they had fallen a little apart from each other and were perfectly stillno not quite in a white patch of light where the moon shone through the branches a mans hand was plucking spasmodically at the grass suddenly the woman stirred and uttered a cry then another and another she was living she was dragging herself toward the hedge frank dropped his gun and ran back along the path shaking stumbling gasping he had never imagined such horror the cries followed him they grew fainter and thicker as if she were choking he dropped on his knees beside the hedge and crouched like a rabbit listening fainter fainter a sound like a whine againa moananothersilence frank scrambled to his feet and ran on groaning and praying from habit he went toward the house where he was used to being soothed when he had worked himself into a frenzy but at the sight of the black open door he started back he knew that he had murdered somebody that a woman was bleeding and moaning in the orchard but he had not realized before that it was his wife the gate stared him in the face he threw his hands over his head which way to turn he lifted his tormented face and looked at the sky holy mother of god not to suffer she was a good girlnot to suffer frank had been wont to see himself in dramatic situations but now when he stood by the windmill in the bright space between the barn and the house facing his own black doorway he did not see himself at all he stood like the hare when the dogs are approaching from all sides and he ran like a hare back and forth about that moonlit space before he could make up his mind to go into the dark stable for a horse the thought of going into a doorway was terrible to him he caught emils horse by the bit and led it out he could not have buckled a bridle on his own after two or three attempts he lifted himself into the saddle and started for hanover if he could catch the one oclock train he had money enough to get as far as omaha while he was thinking dully of this in some less sensitized part of his brain his acuter faculties were going over and over the cries he had heard in the orchard terror was the only thing that kept him from going back to her terror that she might still be she that she might still be suffering a woman mutilated and bleeding in his orchardit was because it was a woman that he was so afraid it was inconceivable that he should have hurt a woman he would rather be eaten by wild beasts than see her move on the ground as she had moved in the orchard why had she been so careless she knew he was like a crazy man when he was angry she had more than once taken that gun away from him and held it when he was angry with other people once it had gone off while they were struggling over it she was never afraid but when she knew him why hadnt she been more careful didnt she have all summer before her to love emil bergson in without taking such chances probably she had met the smirka boy too down there in the orchard he didnt care she could have met all the men on the divide there and welcome if only she hadnt brought this horror on him there was a wrench in franks mind he did not honestly believe that of her he knew that he was doing her wrong he stopped his horse to admit this to himself the more directly to think it out the more clearly he knew that he was to blame for three years he had been trying to break her spirit she had a way of making the best of things that seemed to him a sentimental affectation he wanted his wife to resent that he was wasting his best years among these stupid and unappreciative people but she had seemed to find the people quite good enough if he ever got rich he meant to buy her pretty clothes and take her to california in a pullman car and treat her like a lady but in the mean time he wanted her to feel that life was as ugly and as unjust as he felt it he had tried to make her life ugly he had refused to share any of the little pleasures she was so plucky about making for herself she could be gay about the least thing in the world but she must be gay when she first came to him her faith in him her adorationfrank struck the mare with his fist why had marie made him do this thing why had she brought this upon him he was overwhelmed by sickening misfortune all at once he heard her cries againhe had forgotten for a moment maria he sobbed aloud maria when frank was halfway to hanover the motion of his horse brought on a violent attack of nausea after it had passed he rode on again but he could think of nothing except his physical weakness and his desire to be comforted by his wife he wanted to get into his own bed had his wife been at home he would have turned and gone back to her meekly enough viii when old ivar climbed down from his loft at four oclock the next morning he came upon emils mare jaded and latherstained her bridle broken chewing the scattered tufts of hay outside the stable door the old man was thrown into a fright at once he put the mare in her stall threw her a measure of oats and then set out as fast as his bowlegs could carry him on the path to the nearest neighbor something is wrong with that boy some misfortune has come upon us he would never have used her so in his right senses it is not his way to abuse his mare the old man kept muttering as he scuttled through the short wet pasture grass on his bare feet while ivar was hurrying across the fields the first long rays of the sun were reaching down between the orchard boughs to those two dewdrenched figures the story of what had happened was written plainly on the orchard grass and on the white mulberries that had fallen in the night and were covered with dark stain for emil the chapter had been short he was shot in the heart and had rolled over on his back and died his face was turned up to the sky and his brows were drawn in a frown as if he had realized that something had befallen him but for marie shabata it had not been so easy one ball had torn through her right lung another had shattered the carotid artery she must have started up and gone toward the hedge leaving a trail of blood there she had fallen and bled from that spot there was another trail heavier than the first where she must have dragged herself back to emils body once there she seemed not to have struggled any more she had lifted her head to her lovers breast taken his hand in both her own and bled quietly to death she was lying on her right side in an easy and natural position her cheek on emils shoulder on her face there was a look of ineffable content her lips were parted a little her eyes were lightly closed as if in a daydream or a light slumber after she lay down there she seemed not to have moved an eyelash the hand she held was covered with dark stains where she had kissed it but the stained slippery grass the darkened mulberries told only half the story above marie and emil two white butterflies from franks alfalfafield were fluttering in and out among the interlacing shadows diving and soaring now close together now far apart and in the long grass by the fence the last wild roses of the year opened their pink hearts to die when ivar reached the path by the hedge he saw shabatas rifle lying in the way he turned and peered through the branches falling upon his knees as if his legs had been mowed from under him merciful god he groaned alexandra too had risen early that morning because of her anxiety about emil she was in emils room upstairs when from the window she saw ivar coming along the path that led from the shabatas he was running like a spent man tottering and lurching from side to side ivar never drank and alexandra thought at once that one of his spells had come upon him and that he must be in a very bad way indeed she ran downstairs and hurried out to meet him to hide his infirmity from the eyes of her household the old man fell in the road at her feet and caught her hand over which he bowed his shaggy head mistress mistress he sobbed it has fallen sin and death for the young ones god have mercy upon us part v alexandra i ivar was sitting at a cobblers bench in the barn mending harness by the light of a lantern and repeating to himself the 101st psalm it was only five oclock of a midoctober day but a storm had come up in the afternoon bringing black clouds a cold wind and torrents of rain the old man wore his buffaloskin coat and occasionally stopped to warm his fingers at the lantern suddenly a woman burst into the shed as if she had been blown in accompanied by a shower of raindrops it was signa wrapped in a mans overcoat and wearing a pair of boots over her shoes in time of trouble signa had come back to stay with her mistress for she was the only one of the maids from whom alexandra would accept much personal service it was three months now since the news of the terrible thing that had happened in frank shabatas orchard had first run like a fire over the divide signa and nelse were staying on with alexandra until winter ivar signa exclaimed as she wiped the rain from her face do you know where she is the old man put down his cobblers knife who the mistress yes she went away about three oclock i happened to look out of the window and saw her going across the fields in her thin dress and sunhat and now this storm has come on i thought she was going to mrs hillers and i telephoned as soon as the thunder stopped but she had not been there im afraid she is out somewhere and will get her death of cold ivar put on his cap and took up the lantern ja ja we will see i will hitch the boys mare to the cart and go signa followed him across the wagonshed to the horses stable she was shivering with cold and excitement where do you suppose she can be ivar the old man lifted a set of single harness carefully from its peg how should i know but you think she is at the graveyard dont you signa persisted so do i oh i wish she would be more like herself i cant believe its alexandra bergson come to this with no head about anything i have to tell her when to eat and when to go to bed patience patience sister muttered ivar as he settled the bit in the horses mouth when the eyes of the flesh are shut the eyes of the spirit are open she will have a message from those who are gone and that will bring her peace until then we must bear with her you and i are the only ones who have weight with her she trusts us how awful its been these last three months signa held the lantern so that he could see to buckle the straps it dont seem right that we must all be so miserable why do we all have to be punished seems to me like good times would never come again ivar expressed himself in a deep sigh but said nothing he stooped and took a sandburr from his toe ivar signa asked suddenly will you tell me why you go barefoot all the time i lived here in the house i wanted to ask you is it for a penance or what no sister it is for the indulgence of the body from my youth up i have had a strong rebellious body and have been subject to every kind of temptation even in age my temptations are prolonged it was necessary to make some allowances and the feet as i understand it are free members there is no divine prohibition for them in the ten commandments the hands the tongue the eyes the heart all the bodily desires we are commanded to subdue but the feet are free members i indulge them without harm to any one even to trampling in filth when my desires are low they are quickly cleaned again signa did not laugh she looked thoughtful as she followed ivar out to the wagonshed and held the shafts up for him while he backed in the mare and buckled the holdbacks you have been a good friend to the mistress ivar she murmured and you god be with you replied ivar as he clambered into the cart and put the lantern under the oilcloth lapcover now for a ducking my girl he said to the mare gathering up the reins as they emerged from the shed a stream of water running off the thatch struck the mare on the neck she tossed her head indignantly then struck out bravely on the soft ground slipping back again and again as she climbed the hill to the main road between the rain and the darkness ivar could see very little so he let emils mare have the rein keeping her head in the right direction when the ground was level he turned her out of the dirt road upon the sod where she was able to trot without slipping before ivar reached the graveyard three miles from the house the storm had spent itself and the downpour had died into a soft dripping rain the sky and the land were a dark smoke color and seemed to be coming together like two waves when ivar stopped at the gate and swung out his lantern a white figure rose from beside john bergsons white stone the old man sprang to the ground and shuffled toward the gate calling mistress mistress alexandra hurried to meet him and put her hand on his shoulder tyst ivar theres nothing to be worried about im sorry if ive scared you all i didnt notice the storm till it was on me and i couldnt walk against it im glad youve come i am so tired i didnt know how id ever get home ivar swung the lantern up so that it shone in her face gud you are enough to frighten us mistress you look like a drowned woman how could you do such a thing groaning and mumbling he led her out of the gate and helped her into the cart wrapping her in the dry blankets on which he had been sitting alexandra smiled at his solicitude not much use in that ivar you will only shut the wet in i dont feel so cold now but im heavy and numb im glad you came ivar turned the mare and urged her into a sliding trot her feet sent back a continual spatter of mud alexandra spoke to the old man as they jogged along through the sullen gray twilight of the storm ivar i think it has done me good to get cold clear through like this once i dont believe i shall suffer so much any more when you get so near the dead they seem more real than the living worldly thoughts leave one ever since emil died ive suffered so when it rained now that ive been out in it with him i shant dread it after you once get cold clear through the feeling of the rain on you is sweet it seems to bring back feelings you had when you were a baby it carries you back into the dark before you were born you cant see things but they come to you somehow and you know them and arent afraid of them maybe its like that with the dead if they feel anything at all its the old things before they were born that comfort people like the feeling of their own bed does when they are little mistress said ivar reproachfully those are bad thoughts the dead are in paradise then he hung his head for he did not believe that emil was in paradise when they got home signa had a fire burning in the sittingroom stove she undressed alexandra and gave her a hot footbath while ivar made ginger tea in the kitchen when alexandra was in bed wrapped in hot blankets ivar came in with his tea and saw that she drank it signa asked permission to sleep on the slat lounge outside her door alexandra endured their attentions patiently but she was glad when they put out the lamp and left her as she lay alone in the dark it occurred to her for the first time that perhaps she was actually tired of life all the physical operations of life seemed difficult and painful she longed to be free from her own body which ached and was so heavy and longing itself was heavy she yearned to be free of that as she lay with her eyes closed she had again more vividly than for many years the old illusion of her girlhood of being lifted and carried lightly by some one very strong he was with her a long while this time and carried her very far and in his arms she felt free from pain when he laid her down on her bed again she opened her eyes and for the first time in her life she saw him saw him clearly though the room was dark and his face was covered he was standing in the doorway of her room his white cloak was thrown over his face and his head was bent a little forward his shoulders seemed as strong as the foundations of the world his right arm bared from the elbow was dark and gleaming like bronze and she knew at once that it was the arm of the mightiest of all lovers she knew at last for whom it was she had waited and where he would carry her that she told herself was very well then she went to sleep alexandra wakened in the morning with nothing worse than a hard cold and a stiff shoulder she kept her bed for several days and it was during that time that she formed a resolution to go to lincoln to see frank shabata ever since she last saw him in the courtroom franks haggard face and wild eyes had haunted her the trial had lasted only three days frank had given himself up to the police in omaha and pleaded guilty of killing without malice and without premeditation the gun was of course against him and the judge had given him the full sentenceten years he had now been in the state penitentiary for a month frank was the only one alexandra told herself for whom anything could be done he had been less in the wrong than any of them and he was paying the heaviest penalty she often felt that she herself had been more to blame than poor frank from the time the shabatas had first moved to the neighboring farm she had omitted no opportunity of throwing marie and emil together because she knew frank was surly about doing little things to help his wife she was always sending emil over to spade or plant or carpenter for marie she was glad to have emil see as much as possible of an intelligent citybred girl like their neighbor she noticed that it improved his manners she knew that emil was fond of marie but it had never occurred to her that emils feeling might be different from her own she wondered at herself now but she had never thought of danger in that direction if marie had been unmarriedoh yes then she would have kept her eyes open but the mere fact that she was shabatas wife for alexandra settled everything that she was beautiful impulsive barely two years older than emil these facts had had no weight with alexandra emil was a good boy and only bad boys ran after married women now alexandra could in a measure realize that marie was after all marie not merely a married woman sometimes when alexandra thought of her it was with an aching tenderness the moment she had reached them in the orchard that morning everything was clear to her there was something about those two lying in the grass something in the way marie had settled her cheek on emils shoulder that told her everything she wondered then how they could have helped loving each other how she could have helped knowing that they must emils cold frowning face the girls contentalexandra had felt awe of them even in the first shock of her grief the idleness of those days in bed the relaxation of body which attended them enabled alexandra to think more calmly than she had done since emils death she and frank she told herself were left out of that group of friends who had been overwhelmed by disaster she must certainly see frank shabata even in the courtroom her heart had grieved for him he was in a strange country he had no kinsmen or friends and in a moment he had ruined his life being what he was she felt frank could not have acted otherwise she could understand his behavior more easily than she could understand maries yes she must go to lincoln to see frank shabata the day after emils funeral alexandra had written to carl linstrum a single page of notepaper a bare statement of what had happened she was not a woman who could write much about such a thing and about her own feelings she could never write very freely she knew that carl was away from postoffices prospecting somewhere in the interior before he started he had written her where he expected to go but her ideas about alaska were vague as the weeks went by and she heard nothing from him it seemed to alexandra that her heart grew hard against carl she began to wonder whether she would not do better to finish her life alone what was left of life seemed unimportant ii late in the afternoon of a brilliant october day alexandra bergson dressed in a black suit and travelinghat alighted at the burlington depot in lincoln she drove to the lindell hotel where she had stayed two years ago when she came up for emils commencement in spite of her usual air of sureness and selfpossession alexandra felt ill at ease in hotels and she was glad when she went to the clerks desk to register that there were not many people in the lobby she had her supper early wearing her hat and black jacket down to the diningroom and carrying her handbag after supper she went out for a walk it was growing dark when she reached the university campus she did not go into the grounds but walked slowly up and down the stone walk outside the long iron fence looking through at the young men who were running from one building to another at the lights shining from the armory and the library a squad of cadets were going through their drill behind the armory and the commands of their young officer rang out at regular intervals so sharp and quick that alexandra could not understand them two stalwart girls came down the library steps and out through one of the iron gates as they passed her alexandra was pleased to hear them speaking bohemian to each other every few moments a boy would come running down the flagged walk and dash out into the street as if he were rushing to announce some wonder to the world alexandra felt a great tenderness for them all she wished one of them would stop and speak to her she wished she could ask them whether they had known emil as she lingered by the south gate she actually did encounter one of the boys he had on his drill cap and was swinging his books at the end of a long strap it was dark by this time he did not see her and ran against her he snatched off his cap and stood bareheaded and panting im awfully sorry he said in a bright clear voice with a rising inflection as if he expected her to say something oh it was my fault said alexandra eagerly are you an old student here may i ask no maam im a freshie just off the farm cherry county were you hunting somebody no thank you that is alexandra wanted to detain him that is i would like to find some of my brothers friends he graduated two years ago then youd have to try the seniors wouldnt you lets see i dont know any of them yet but therell be sure to be some of them around the library that red building right there he pointed thank you ill try there said alexandra lingeringly oh thats all right goodnight the lad clapped his cap on his head and ran straight down eleventh street alexandra looked after him wistfully she walked back to her hotel unreasonably comforted what a nice voice that boy had and how polite he was i know emil was always like that to women and again after she had undressed and was standing in her nightgown brushing her long heavy hair by the electric light she remembered him and said to herself i dont think i ever heard a nicer voice than that boy had i hope he will get on well here cherry county thats where the hay is so fine and the coyotes can scratch down to water at nine oclock the next morning alexandra presented herself at the wardens office in the state penitentiary the warden was a german a ruddy cheerfullooking man who had formerly been a harnessmaker alexandra had a letter to him from the german banker in hanover as he glanced at the letter mr schwartz put away his pipe that big bohemian is it sure hes gettin along fine said mr schwartz cheerfully i am glad to hear that i was afraid he might be quarrelsome and get himself into more trouble mr schwartz if you have time i would like to tell you a little about frank shabata and why i am interested in him the warden listened genially while she told him briefly something of franks history and character but he did not seem to find anything unusual in her account sure ill keep an eye on him well take care of him all right he said rising you can talk to him here while i go to see to things in the kitchen ill have him sent in he ought to be done washing out his cell by this time we have to keep em clean you know the warden paused at the door speaking back over his shoulder to a pale young man in convicts clothes who was seated at a desk in the corner writing in a big ledger bertie when 1037 is brought in you just step out and give this lady a chance to talk the young man bowed his head and bent over his ledger again when mr schwartz disappeared alexandra thrust her blackedged handkerchief nervously into her handbag coming out on the streetcar she had not had the least dread of meeting frank but since she had been here the sounds and smells in the corridor the look of the men in convicts clothes who passed the glass door of the wardens office affected her unpleasantly the wardens clock ticked the young convicts pen scratched busily in the big book and his sharp shoulders were shaken every few seconds by a loose cough which he tried to smother it was easy to see that he was a sick man alexandra looked at him timidly but he did not once raise his eyes he wore a white shirt under his striped jacket a high collar and a necktie very carefully tied his hands were thin and white and well cared for and he had a seal ring on his little finger when he heard steps approaching in the corridor he rose blotted his book put his pen in the rack and left the room without raising his eyes through the door he opened a guard came in bringing frank shabata you the lady that wanted to talk to 1037 here he is be on your good behavior now he can set down lady seeing that alexandra remained standing push that white button when youre through with him and ill come the guard went out and alexandra and frank were left alone alexandra tried not to see his hideous clothes she tried to look straight into his face which she could scarcely believe was his it was already bleached to a chalky gray his lips were colorless his fine teeth looked yellowish he glanced at alexandra sullenly blinked as if he had come from a dark place and one eyebrow twitched continually she felt at once that this interview was a terrible ordeal to him his shaved head showing the conformation of his skull gave him a criminal look which he had not had during the trial alexandra held out her hand frank she said her eyes filling suddenly i hope youll let me be friendly with you i understand how you did it i dont feel hard toward you they were more to blame than you frank jerked a dirty blue handkerchief from his trousers pocket he had begun to cry he turned away from alexandra i never did mean to do noting to dat woman he muttered i never mean to do noting to dat boy i aint had noting agin dat boy i always like dat boy fine an then i find him he stopped the feeling went out of his face and eyes he dropped into a chair and sat looking stolidly at the floor his hands hanging loosely between his knees the handkerchief lying across his striped leg he seemed to have stirred up in his mind a disgust that had paralyzed his faculties i havent come up here to blame you frank i think they were more to blame than you alexandra too felt benumbed frank looked up suddenly and stared out of the office window i guess dat place all go to hell what i work so hard on he said with a slow bitter smile i not care a damn he stopped and rubbed the palm of his hand over the light bristles on his head with annoyance i no can tink without my hair he complained i forget english we not talk here except swear alexandra was bewildered frank seemed to have undergone a change of personality there was scarcely anything by which she could recognize her handsome bohemian neighbor he seemed somehow not altogether human she did not know what to say to him you do not feel hard to me frank she asked at last frank clenched his fist and broke out in excitement i not feel hard at no woman i tell you i not that kinda man i never hit my wife no never i hurt her when she devil me something awful he struck his fist down on the wardens desk so hard that he afterward stroked it absently a pale pink crept over his neck and face two tree years i know dat woman don care no more bout me alexandra bergson i know she after some other man i know her oooo an i aint never hurt her i never woulda done dat if i aint had dat gun along i don know what in hell make me take dat gun she always say i aint no man to carry gun if she been in dat house where she oughta beenbut das a foolish talk frank rubbed his head and stopped suddenly as he had stopped before alexandra felt that there was something strange in the way he chilled off as if something came up in him that extinguished his power of feeling or thinking yes frank she said kindly i know you never meant to hurt marie frank smiled at her queerly his eyes filled slowly with tears you know i most forgit dat womans name she aint got no name for me no more i never hate my wife but dat woman what make me do dathonest to god but i hate her i no man to fight i don want to kill no boy and no woman i not care how many men she take under dat tree i no care for noting but dat fine boy i kill alexandra bergson i guess i go crazy sure nough alexandra remembered the little yellow cane she had found in franks clothescloset she thought of how he had come to this country a gay young fellow so attractive that the prettiest bohemian girl in omaha had run away with him it seemed unreasonable that life should have landed him in such a place as this she blamed marie bitterly and why with her happy affectionate nature should she have brought destruction and sorrow to all who had loved her even to poor old joe tovesky the uncle who used to carry her about so proudly when she was a little girl that was the strangest thing of all was there then something wrong in being warmhearted and impulsive like that alexandra hated to think so but there was emil in the norwegian graveyard at home and here was frank shabata alexandra rose and took him by the hand frank shabata i am never going to stop trying until i get you pardoned ill never give the governor any peace i know i can get you out of this place frank looked at her distrustfully but he gathered confidence from her face alexandra he said earnestly if i git outa here i not trouble dis country no more i go back where i come from see my mother alexandra tried to withdraw her hand but frank held on to it nervously he put out his finger and absently touched a button on her black jacket alexandra he said in a low tone looking steadily at the button you ain tink i use dat girl awful bad before no frank we wont talk about that alexandra said pressing his hand i cant help emil now so im going to do what i can for you you know i dont go away from home often and i came up here on purpose to tell you this the warden at the glass door looked in inquiringly alexandra nodded and he came in and touched the white button on his desk the guard appeared and with a sinking heart alexandra saw frank led away down the corridor after a few words with mr schwartz she left the prison and made her way to the streetcar she had refused with horror the wardens cordial invitation to go through the institution as the car lurched over its uneven roadbed back toward lincoln alexandra thought of how she and frank had been wrecked by the same storm and of how although she could come out into the sunlight she had not much more left in her life than he she remembered some lines from a poem she had liked in her schooldays henceforth the world will only be a wider prisonhouse to me and sighed a disgust of life weighed upon her heart some such feeling as had twice frozen frank shabatas features while they talked together she wished she were back on the divide when alexandra entered her hotel the clerk held up one finger and beckoned to her as she approached his desk he handed her a telegram alexandra took the yellow envelope and looked at it in perplexity then stepped into the elevator without opening it as she walked down the corridor toward her room she reflected that she was in a manner immune from evil tidings on reaching her room she locked the door and sitting down on a chair by the dresser opened the telegram it was from hanover and it read arrived hanover last night shall wait here until you come please hurry carl linstrum alexandra put her head down on the dresser and burst into tears iii the next afternoon carl and alexandra were walking across the fields from mrs hillers alexandra had left lincoln after midnight and carl had met her at the hanover station early in the morning after they reached home alexandra had gone over to mrs hillers to leave a little present she had bought for her in the city they stayed at the old ladys door but a moment and then came out to spend the rest of the afternoon in the sunny fields alexandra had taken off her black traveling suit and put on a white dress partly because she saw that her black clothes made carl uncomfortable and partly because she felt oppressed by them herself they seemed a little like the prison where she had worn them yesterday and to be out of place in the open fields carl had changed very little his cheeks were browner and fuller he looked less like a tired scholar than when he went away a year ago but no one even now would have taken him for a man of business his soft lustrous black eyes his whimsical smile would be less against him in the klondike than on the divide there are always dreamers on the frontier carl and alexandra had been talking since morning her letter had never reached him he had first learned of her misfortune from a san francisco paper four weeks old which he had picked up in a saloon and which contained a brief account of frank shabatas trial when he put down the paper he had already made up his mind that he could reach alexandra as quickly as a letter could and ever since he had been on the way day and night by the fastest boats and trains he could catch his steamer had been held back two days by rough weather as they came out of mrs hillers garden they took up their talk again where they had left it but could you come away like that carl without arranging things could you just walk off and leave your business alexandra asked carl laughed prudent alexandra you see my dear i happen to have an honest partner i trust him with everything in fact its been his enterprise from the beginning you know im in it only because he took me in ill have to go back in the spring perhaps you will want to go with me then we havent turned up millions yet but weve got a start thats worth following but this winter id like to spend with you you wont feel that we ought to wait longer on emils account will you alexandra alexandra shook her head no carl i dont feel that way about it and surely you neednt mind anything lou and oscar say now they are much angrier with me about emil now than about you they say it was all my fault that i ruined him by sending him to college no i dont care a button for lou or oscar the moment i knew you were in trouble the moment i thought you might need me it all looked different youve always been a triumphant kind of person carl hesitated looking sidewise at her strong full figure but you do need me now alexandra she put her hand on his arm i needed you terribly when it happened carl i cried for you at night then everything seemed to get hard inside of me and i thought perhaps i should never care for you again but when i got your telegram yesterday thenthen it was just as it used to be you are all i have in the world you know carl pressed her hand in silence they were passing the shabatas empty house now but they avoided the orchard path and took one that led over by the pasture pond can you understand it carl alexandra murmured i have had nobody but ivar and signa to talk to do talk to me can you understand it could you have believed that of marie tovesky i would have been cut to pieces little by little before i would have betrayed her trust in me carl looked at the shining spot of water before them maybe she was cut to pieces too alexandra i am sure she tried hard they both did that was why emil went to mexico of course and he was going away again you tell me though he had only been home three weeks you remember that sunday when i went with emil up to the french church fair i thought that day there was some kind of feeling something unusual between them i meant to talk to you about it but on my way back i met lou and oscar and got so angry that i forgot everything else you mustnt be hard on them alexandra sit down here by the pond a minute i want to tell you something they sat down on the grasstufted bank and carl told her how he had seen emil and marie out by the pond that morning more than a year ago and how young and charming and full of grace they had seemed to him it happens like that in the world sometimes alexandra he added earnestly ive seen it before there are women who spread ruin around them through no fault of theirs just by being too beautiful too full of life and love they cant help it people come to them as people go to a warm fire in winter i used to feel that in her when she was a little girl do you remember how all the bohemians crowded round her in the store that day when she gave emil her candy you remember those yellow sparks in her eyes alexandra sighed yes people couldnt help loving her poor frank does even now i think though hes got himself in such a tangle that for a long time his love has been bitterer than his hate but if you saw there was anything wrong you ought to have told me carl carl took her hand and smiled patiently my dear it was something one felt in the air as you feel the spring coming or a storm in summer i didnt see anything simply when i was with those two young things i felt my blood go quicker i felthow shall i say itan acceleration of life after i got away it was all too delicate too intangible to write about alexandra looked at him mournfully i try to be more liberal about such things than i used to be i try to realize that we are not all made alike only why couldnt it have been raoul marcel or jan smirka why did it have to be my boy because he was the best there was i suppose they were both the best you had here the sun was dropping low in the west when the two friends rose and took the path again the strawstacks were throwing long shadows the owls were flying home to the prairiedog town when they came to the corner where the pastures joined alexandras twelve young colts were galloping in a drove over the brow of the hill carl said alexandra i should like to go up there with you in the spring i havent been on the water since we crossed the ocean when i was a little girl after we first came out here i used to dream sometimes about the shipyard where father worked and a little sort of inlet full of masts alexandra paused after a moments thought she said but you would never ask me to go away for good would you of course not my dearest i think i know how you feel about this country as well as you do yourself carl took her hand in both his own and pressed it tenderly yes i still feel that way though emil is gone when i was on the train this morning and we got near hanover i felt something like i did when i drove back with emil from the river that time in the dry year i was glad to come back to it ive lived here a long time there is great peace here carl and freedom i thought when i came out of that prison where poor frank is that i should never feel free again but i do here alexandra took a deep breath and looked off into the red west you belong to the land carl murmured as you have always said now more than ever yes now more than ever you remember what you once said about the graveyard and the old story writing itself over only it is we who write it with the best we have they paused on the last ridge of the pasture overlooking the house and the windmill and the stables that marked the site of john bergsons homestead on every side the brown waves of the earth rolled away to meet the sky lou and oscar cant see those things said alexandra suddenly suppose i do will my land to their children what difference will that make the land belongs to the future carl thats the way it seems to me how many of the names on the county clerks plat will be there in fifty years i might as well try to will the sunset over there to my brothers children we come and go but the land is always here and the people who love it and understand it are the people who own itfor a little while carl looked at her wonderingly she was still gazing into the west and in her face there was that exalted serenity that sometimes came to her at moments of deep feeling the level rays of the sinking sun shone in her clear eyes why are you thinking of such things now alexandra i had a dream before i went to lincolnbut i will tell you about that afterward after we are married it will never come true now in the way i thought it might she took carls arm and they walked toward the gate how many times we have walked this path together carl how many times we will walk it again does it seem to you like coming back to your own place do you feel at peace with the world here i think we shall be very happy i havent any fears i think when friends marry they are safe we dont suffer likethose young ones alexandra ended with a sigh they had reached the gate before carl opened it he drew alexandra to him and kissed her softly on her lips and on her eyes she leaned heavily on his shoulder i am tired she murmured i have been very lonely carl they went into the house together leaving the divide behind them under the evening star fortunate country that is one day to receive hearts like alexandras into its bosom to give them out again in the yellow wheat in the rustling corn in the shining eyes of youth
