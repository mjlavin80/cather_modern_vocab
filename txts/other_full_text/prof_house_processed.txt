the moving was over and done professor st peter was alone in the dismantled house where he had lived ever since his marriage where he had worked out his career and brought up his two daughters it was almost as ugly as it is possible for a house to be square three stories in height painted the colour of ashesthe front porch just too narrow for comfort with a slanting floor and sagging steps as he walked slowly about the empty echoing rooms on that bright september morning the professor regarded thoughtfully the needless inconveniences he had put up with for so long the stairs that were too steep the halls that were too cramped the awkward oak mantles with thick round posts crowned by bumptious wooden balls over greentiled fireplaces certain wobbly stair treads certain creaky boards in the upstairs hall had made him wince many times a day for twentyodd yearsand they still creaked and wobbled he had a deft hand with tools he could easily have fixed them but there were always so many things to fix and there was not time enough to go round he went into the kitchen where he had carpentered under a succession of cooks went up to the bathroom on the second floor where there was only a painted tin tub the taps were so old that no plumber could ever screw them tight enough to stop the drip the window could only be coaxed up and down by wriggling and the doors of the linen closet didnt fit he had sympathized with his daughters dissatisfaction though he could never quite agree with them that the bath should be the most attractive room in the house he had spent the happiest years of his youth in a house at versailles where it distinctly was not and he had known many charming people who had no bath at all however as his wife said if your country has contributed one thing at least to civilization why not have it many a night after blowing out his study lamp he had leaped into that tub clad in his pyjamas to give it another coat of some one of the many paints that were advertised to behave like porcelain and didnt the professor in pyjamas was not an unpleasant sight for looks the fewer clothes he had on the better anything that clung to his body showed it to be built upon extremely good bones with the slender hips and springy shoulders of a tireless swimmer though he was born on lake michigan of mixed stock canadian french on one side and american farmers on the other st peter was commonly said to look like a spaniard that was possibly because he had been in spain a good deal and was an authority on certain phases of spanish history he had a long brown face with an oval chin over which he wore a close trimmed vandyke like a tuft of shiny black fur with this silky very black hair he had a tawny skin with gold lights in it a hawk nose and hawklike eyesbrown and gold and green they were set in ample cavities with plenty of room to move about under thick curly black eyebrows that turned up sharply at the outer ends like military moustaches his wickedlooking eyebrows made his students call him mephistophelesand there was no evading the searching eyes underneath them eyes that in a flash could pick out a friend or an unusual stranger from a throng they had lost none of their fire though just now the man behind them was feeling a diminution of ardour his daughter kathleen who had done several successful studies of him in watercolour had once saidthe thing that really makes papa handsome is the modelling of his head between the top of his ear and his crown it is quite the best thing about him that part of his head was high polished hard as bronze and the closegrowing black hair threw off a streak of light along the rounded ridge where the skull was fullest the mould of his head on the side was so individual and definite so far from casual that it was more like a statues head than a mans from one of the dismantled windows the professor happened to look out into his back garden and at that cheerful sight he went quickly downstairs and escaped from the dusty air and brutal light of the empty rooms his walledin garden had been the comfort of his lifeand it was the one thing his neighbours held against him he started to make it soon after the birth of his first daughter when his wife began to be unreasonable about his spending so much time at the lake and on the tennis court in this undertaking he got help and encouragement from his landlord a retired german farmer goodnatured and lenient about everything but spending money if the professor happened to have a new baby at home or a faculty dinner or an illness in the family or any unusual expense appelhoff cheerfully waited for the rent but pay for repairs he would not when it was a question of the garden however the old man sometimes stretched a point he helped his tenant with seeds and slips and sound advice and with his twisted old back he even spent a little money to bear half the expense of the stucco wall the professor had succeeded in making a french garden in hamilton there was not a blade of grass it was a tidy halfacre of glistening gravel and glistening shrubs and bright flowers there were trees of course a spreading horsechestnut a row of slender lombardy poplars at the back along the white wall and in the middle two symmetrical roundtopped lindentrees masses of greenbrier grew in the corners the prickly stems interwoven and clipped until they were like great bushes there was a bed for salad herbs salmonpink geraniums dripped over the wall the french marigolds and dahlias were just now at their bestsuch dahlias as no one else in hamilton could grow st peter had tended this bit of ground for over twenty years and had got the upper hand of it in the spring when homesickness for other lands and the fret of things unaccomplished awoke he worked off his discontent here in the long hot summers when he could not go abroad he stayed at home with his garden sending his wife and daughters to colorado to escape the humid prairie heat so nourishing to wheat and corn so exhausting to human beings in those months when he was a bachelor again he brought down his books and papers and worked in a deck chair under the lindentrees breakfasted and lunched and had his tea in the garden and it was there he and tom outland used to sit and talk half through the warm soft nights on this september morning however st peter knew that he could not evade the unpleasant effects of change by tarrying among his autumn flowers he must plunge in like a man and get used to the feeling that under his workroom there was a dead empty house he broke off a geranium blossom and with it still in his hand went resolutely up two flights of stairs to the third floor where under the slope of the mansard roof there was one room still furnishedthat is if it had ever been furnished the low ceiling sloped down on three sides the slant being interrupted on the east by a single square window swinging outward on hinges and held ajar by a hook in the sill this was the sole opening for light and air walls and ceiling alike were covered with a yellow paper which had once been very ugly but had faded into inoffensive neutrality the matting on the floor was worn and scratchy against the wall stood an old walnut table with one leaf up holding piles of orderly papers before it was a canebacked office chair that turned on a screw this dark den had for many years been the professors study downstairs off the back parlour he had a show study with roomy shelves where his library was housed and a proper desk at which he wrote letters but it was a sham this was the place where he worked and not he alone for three weeks in the fall and again three in the spring he shared his cuddy with augusta the sewingwoman niece of his old landlord a reliable methodical spinster a german catholic and very devout since augusta finished her days work at five oclock and the professor on weekdays worked here only at night they did not elbow each other too much besides neither was devoid of consideration every evening before she left augusta swept up the scraps from the floor rolled her patterns closed the sewingmachine and picked ravellings off the boxcouch so that there would be no threads to stick to the professors old smokingjacket if he should happen to lie down for a moment in workinghours st peter in his turn when he put out his lamp after midnight was careful to brush away ashes and tobacco crumbssmoking was very distasteful to augustaand to open the hinged window back as far as it would go on the second hook so that the night wind might carry away the smell of his pipe as much as possible the unfinished dresses which she left hanging on the forms however were often so saturated with smoke that he knew she found it a trial to work on them the next morning these forms were the subject of much banter between them the one which augusta called the bust stood in the darkest corner of the room upon a high wooden chest in which blankets and winter wraps were yearly stored it was a headless armless female torso covered with strong black cotton and so richly developed in the part for which it was named that the professor once explained to augusta how in calling it so she followed a natural law of language termed for convenience metonymy augusta enjoyed the professor when he was risqueacute since she was sure of his ultimate delicacy though this figure looked so ample and billowy as if you might lay your head upon its deepbreathing softness and rest safe forever if you touched it you suffered a severe shock no matter how many times you had touched it before it presented the most unsympathetic surface imaginable its hardness was not that of wood which responds to concussion with living vibration and is stimulating to the hand nor that of felt which drinks something from the fingers it was a dead opaque lumpy solidity like chunks of putty or tightly packed sawdustvery disappointing to the tactile sense yet somehow always fooling you again for no matter how often you had bumped up against that torso you could never believe that contact with it would be as bad as it was the second form was more selfrevelatory a fulllength female figure in a smart wire skirt with a trim metal waist line it had no legs as one could see all too well no viscera behind its glistening ribs and its bosom resembled a strong wire birdcage but st peter contended that it had a nervous system when augusta left it clad for the night in a new party dress for rosamond or kathleen it often took on a sprightly tricky air as if it were going out for the evening to make a great show of being harumscarum giddy folle it seemed just on the point of tripping downstairs or on tiptoe waiting for the waltz to begin at times the wire lady was most convincing in her pose as a woman of light behaviour but she never fooled st peter he had his blind spots but he had never been taken in by one of her kind augusta had somehow got it into her head that these forms were unsuitable companions for one engaged in scholarly pursuits and she periodically apologized for their presence when she came to install herself and fulfil her time at the house not at all augusta the professor had often said if they were good enough for monsieur bergeret they are certainly good enough for me this morning as st peter was sitting in his desk chair looking musingly at the pile of papers before him the door opened and there stood augusta herself how astonishing that he had not heard her heavy deliberate tread on the now uncarpeted stair why professor st peter i never thought of finding you here or id have knocked i guess we will have to do our moving together st peter had risenaugusta loved his mannersbut he offered her the sewingmachine chair and resumed his seat sit down augusta and well talk it over im not moving just yetdont want to disturb all my papers im staying on until i finish a piece of writing ive seen your uncle about it ill work here and board at the new house but this is confidential if it were noised about people might begin to say that mrs st peter and i hadhow do they put it parted separated augusta dropped her eyes in an indulgent smile i think people in your station would say separated exactly a good scientific term too well we havent you know but im going to write on here for a while very well sir and i wont always be getting in your way now in the new house you have a beautiful study downstairs and i have a light airy room on the third floor where you wont smell smoke eh oh professor i never really minded augusta spoke with feeling she rose and took up the black bust in her long arms the professor also rose very quickly what are you doing she laughed oh im not going to carry them through the street professor the grocery boy is downstairs with his cart to wheel them over wheel them over why yes to the new house professor ive come a week before my regular time to make curtains and hem linen for mrs st peter ill take everything over this morning except the sewingmachinethats too heavy for the cart so the boy will come back for it with the delivery wagon would you just open the door for me please no i wont not at all you dont need her to make curtains i cant have this room changed if im going to work here he can take the sewingmachineyes but put her back on the chest where she belongs please she does very well there st peter had got to the door and stood with his back against it augusta rested her burden on the edge of the chest but next week ill be working on mrs st peters clothes and ill need the forms as the boys here hell just wheel them over she said soothingly im damned if he will they shant be wheeled they stay right there in their own place you shant take away my ladies i never heard of such a thing augusta was vexed with him now and a little ashamed of him but professor i cant work without my forms theyve been in your way all these years and youve always complained of them so dont be contrary sir i never complained augusta perhaps of certain disappointments they recalled or of cruel biological necessities they implybut of them individually never go and buy some new ones for your airy atelier as many as you wishim said to be rich now am i notgo buy but you cant have my women thats final augusta looked down her nose as she did at church when the dark sins were mentioned professor she said severely i think this time you are carrying a joke too far you never used to from the tilt of her chin he saw that she felt the presence of some improper suggestion no matter what you think you cant have them they considered both were in earnest now augusta was first to break the defiant silence i suppose i am to be allowed to take my patterns your patterns oh yes the cutout things you keep in the couch with my old notebooks certainly you can have them let me lift it for you he raised the hinged top of the boxcouch that stood against the wall under the slope of the ceiling at one end of the upholstered box were piles of notebooks and bundles of manuscript tied up in square packages with masons cord at the other end were many little rolls of patterns cut out of newspapers and tied with bits of ribbon gingham silk georgette notched charts which followed the changing stature and figures of the misses st peter from early childhood to womanhood in the middle of the box patterns and manuscripts interpenetrated i see we shall have some difficulty in separating our life work augusta weve kept our papers together a long while now yes professor when i first came to sew for mrs st peter i never thought i should grow grey in her service he started what other future could augusta possibly have expected this disclosure amazed him well well we mustnt think mournfully of it augusta life doesnt turn out for any of us as we plan he stood and watched her large slow hands travel about among the little packets as she put them into his wastebasket to carry them down to the cart he had often wondered how she managed to sew with hands that folded and unfolded as rigidly as umbrellasno light french touch about augusta when she sewed on a bow it stayed there she herself was tall largeboned flat and stiff with a plain solid face and brown eyes not destitute of fun as she knelt by the couch sorting her patterns he stood beside her his hand on the lid though it would have stayed up unsupported her last remark had troubled him what a fine lot of hair you have augusta you know i think its rather nice that grey wave on each side gives it character youll never need any of this false hair thats in all the shop windows theres altogether too much of that professor so many of my customers are using it nowladies you wouldnt expect would they say most of it was cut off the heads of dead chinamen really its got to be such a frequent thing that the priest spoke against it only last sunday did he indeed why what could he say seems such a personal matter well he said it was getting to be a scandal in the church and a priest couldnt go to see a pious woman any more without finding switches and rats and transformations lying about her room and it was disgusting goodness gracious augusta what business has a priest going to see a woman in the room where she takes off these ornamentsor to see her without them augusta grew red and tried to look angry but her laugh narrowly missed being a giggle he goes to give them the sacrament of course professor youve made up your mind to be contrary today havent you you relieve me greatly yes i suppose in cases of sudden illness the hair would be lying about where it was lightly taken off but as you first quoted the priest augusta it was rather shocking youll never convert me back to the religion of my fathers now if youre going to sew in the new house and im going to work on here who is ever to remind me when its all souls day or ember day or maundy thursday or anything augusta said she must be leaving st peter heard her wellknown tread as she descended the stairs how much she reminded him of to be sure she had been most at the house in the days when his daughters were little girls and needed so many clean frocks it was in those very years that he was beginning his great work when the desire to do it and the difficulties attending such a project strove together in his mind like macbeths two spent swimmersyears when he had the courage to say to himself i will do this dazzling this beautiful this utterly impossible thing during the fifteen years he had been working on his spanish adventures in north america this room had been his centre of operations there had been delightful excursions and digressions the two sabbatical years when he was in spain studying records two summers in the southwest on the trail of his adventurers another in old mexico dashes to france to see his fosterbrothers but the notes and the records and the ideas always came back to this room it was here they were digested and sorted and woven into their proper place in his history fairly considered the sewingroom was the most inconvenient study a man could possibly have but it was the one place in the house where he could get isolation insulation from the engaging drama of domestic life no one was tramping over him and only a vague sense generally pleasant of what went on below came up the narrow stairway there were certainly no other advantages the furnace heat did not reach the third floor there was no way to warm the sewingroom except by a rusty round gas stove with no fluea stove which consumed gas imperfectly and contaminated the air to remedy this the window must be left openotherwise with the ceiling so low the air would speedily become unfit to breathe if the stove were turned down and the window left open a little way a sudden gust of wind would blow the wretched thing out altogether and a deeply absorbed man might be asphyxiated before he knew it the professor had found that the best method in winter was to turn the gas on full and keep the window wide on the hook even if he had to put on a leather jacket over his workingcoat by that arrangement he had somehow managed to get air enough to work by he wondered now why he had never looked about for a better stove a newer model or why he had not at least painted this one flaky with rust but he had been able to get on only by neglecting negative comforts he was by no means an ascetic he knew that he was terribly selfish about personal pleasures fought for them if a thing gave him delight he got it if he sold his shirt for it by doing without many socalled necessities he had managed to have his luxuries he might for instance have had a convenient electric droplight attached to the socket above his writing table preferably he wrote by a faithful kerosene lamp which he filled and tended himself but sometimes he found that the oilcan in the closet was empty then to get more he would have had to go down through the house to the cellar and on his way he would almost surely become interested in what the children were doing or in what his wife was doingor he would notice that the kitchen linoleum was breaking under the sink where the maid kicked it up and he would stop to tack it down on that perilous journey down through the human house he might lose his mood his enthusiasm even his temper so when the lamp was emptyand that usually occurred when he was in the middle of a most important passagehe jammed an eyeshade on his forehead and worked by the glare of that tormenting pearshaped bulb sticking out of the wall on a short curved neck just about four feet above his table it was hard on eyes even as good as his but once at his desk he didnt dare quit it he had found that you can train the mind to be active at a fixed time just as the stomach is trained to be hungry at certain hours of the day if someone in the family happened to be sick he didnt go to his study at all two evenings of the week he spent with his wife and daughters and one evening he and his wife went out to dinner or to the theatre or a concert that left him only four he had saturdays and sundays of course and on those two days he worked like a miner under a landslide augusta was not allowed to come on saturday though she was paid for that day all the while that he was working so fiercely by night he was earning his living during the day carrying full university work and feeding himself out to hundreds of students in lectures and consultations but that was another life st peter had managed for years to live two lives both of them very intense he would willingly have cut down on his university work would willingly have given his students chaff and sawdustmany instructors had nothing else to give them and got on very wellbut his misfortune was that he loved youthhe was weak to it it kindled him if there was one eager eye one doubting critical mind one lively curiosity in a whole lectureroom full of commonplace boys and girls he was its servant that ardour could command him it hadnt worn out with years this responsiveness any more than the magnetic currents wear out it had nothing to do with time but he had burned his candle at both ends to some purposehe had got what he wanted by many petty economies of purse he had managed to be extravagant with not a cent in the world but with his professors salaryhe didnt of course touch his wifes small income from her father by eliminations and combinations so many and subtle that it now made his head ache to think of them he had done full justice to his university lectures and at the same time carried on an engrossing piece of creative work a man can do anything if he wishes to enough st peter believed desire is creation is the magical element in that process if there were an instrument by which to measure desire one could foretell achievement he had been able to measure it roughly just once in his student tom outlandand he had foretold there was one fine thing about this room that had been the scene of so many defeats and triumphs from the window he could see far away just on the horizon a long blue hazy smearlake michigan the inland sea of his childhood whenever he was tired and dull when the white pages before him remained blank or were full of scratched out sentences then he left his desk took the train to a little station twelve miles away and spent a day on the lake with his sailboat jumping out to swim floating on his back alongside then climbing into his boat again when he remembered his childhood he remembered blue water there were certain human figures against it of course his practical strongwilled methodist mother his gentle weanedaway catholic father the old kanuck grandfather various brothers and sisters but the great fact in life the always possible escape from dullness was the lake the sun rose out of it the day began there it was like an open door that nobody could shut the land and all its dreariness could never close in on you you had only to look at the lake and you knew you would soon be free it was the first thing one saw in the morning across the rugged cow pasture studded with shaggy pines and it ran through the days like the weather not a thing thought about but a part of consciousness itself when the ice chunks came in of a winter morning crumbly and white throwing off gold and rosecoloured reflections from a coppercoloured sun behind the grey clouds he didnt observe the detail or know what it was that made him happy but now forty years later he could recall all its aspects perfectly they had made pictures in him when he was unwilling and unconscious when his eyes were merely open wide when he was eight years old his parents sold the lakeside farm and dragged him and his brothers and sisters out to the wheat lands of central kansas st peter nearly died of it never could he forget the few moments on the train when that sudden innocent blue across the sand dunes was dying for ever from his sight it was like sinking for the third time no later anguish and he had had his share went so deep or seemed so final even in his long happy student years with the thierault family in france that stretch of blue water was the one thing he was homesick for in the summer he used to go with the thierault boys to brittany or to the languedoc coast but his lake was itself as the channel and the mediterranean were themselves no he used to tell the boys who were always asking him about le michigan it is altogether different it is a sea and yet it is not salt it is blue but quite another blue yes there are clouds and mists and seagulls buti dont know il est toujours plus naiumlf afterward when st peter was looking for a professorship because he was very much in love and must marry at once out of the several positions offered him he took the one at hamilton not because it was the best but because it seemed to him that any place near the lake was a place where one could live the sight of it from his study window these many years had been of more assistance than all the convenient things he had done without would have been just in that corner under augustas archaic forms he had always meant to put the filingcabinets he had never spared the time or money to buy they would have held all his notes and pamphlets and the spasmodic rough drafts of passages far ahead but he never got them and now he really didnt need them it would be like locking the stable after the horse is stolen for the horse was gonethat was the thing he was feeling most just now in spite of all hed neglected he had completed his spanish adventurers in eight volumeswithout filing cabinets or money or a decent study or a decent stoveand without encouragement heaven knew for all the interest the first three volumes awoke in the world he might as well have dropped them into lake michigan they had been timidly reviewed by other professors of history in technical and educational journals nobody saw that he was trying to do something quite differentthey merely thought he was trying to do the usual thing and had not succeeded very well they recommended to him the more even and genial style of john fiske st peter hadnt he could honestly say cared a whoopnot in those golden days when the whole plan of his narrative was coming clearer and clearer all the time when he could feel his hand growing easier with his material when all the foolish conventions about that kind of writing were falling away and his relation with his work was becoming every day more simple natural and happyhe cared as little as the spanish adventurers themselves what professor soandso thought about them with the fourth volume he began to be aware that a few young men scattered about the united states and england were intensely interested in his experiment with the fifth and sixth they began to express their interest in lectures and in print the two last volumes brought him a certain international reputation and what were called rewardsamong them the oxford prize for history with its five thousand pounds which had built him the new house into which he did not want to move godfrey his wife had gravely said one day when she detected an ironical turn in some remark he made about the new house is there something you would rather have done with that money than to have built a house with it nothing my dear nothing if with that cheque i could have brought back the fun i had writing my history youd never have got your house but one couldnt get that for twenty thousand dollars the great pleasures dont come so cheap there is nothing else thank you     chapter 2   that evening st peter was in the new house dressing for dinner his two daughters and their husbands were dining with them also an english visitor mrs st peter heard the shower going as she passed his door she entered his room and waited until he came out in his bathrobe rubbing his wet inkblack hair with a towel surely youll admit that you like having your own bath she said looking past him into the glittering white cubicle flooded with electric light which he had just quitted whoever said i didnt but more than anything else i like my closets i like having room for all my clothes without hanging one coat on top of another and not having to get down on my marrowbones and fumble in dark corners to find my shoes of course you do and its much more dignified at your age to have a room of your own its convenient certainly though i hope im not so old as to be personally repulsive he glanced into the mirror and straightened his shoulders as if he were trying on a coat mrs st peter laugheda pleasant easy laugh with genuine amusement in it no you are very handsome my dear especially in your bathrobe you grow betterlooking and more intolerant all the time intolerant he put down his shoe and looked up at her the thing that stuck in his mind constantly was that she was growing more and more intolerant about everything except her sonsinlaw that she would probably continue to do so and that he must school himself to bear it i suppose its a natural process she went on but you ought to try try seriously i mean to curb it where it affects the happiness of your daughters you are too severe with scott and louie all young men have foolish vanitiesyou had plenty st peter sat with his elbows on his knees leaning forward and playing absently with the tassels of his bathrobe why lillian i have exercised the virtue of patience with those two young men more than with all the thousands of young ruffians who have gone through my classrooms my forbearance is overstrained its gone flat thats whats the matter with me oh godfrey how can you be such a poor judge of your own behaviour but we wont argue about it now youll put on your dinner coat and do try to be sympathetic and agreeable tonight half an hour later mr and mrs scott mcgregor and mr and mrs louie marsellus arrived and soon after them the english scholar sir edgar spilling so anxious to do the usual thing in america that he wore a morning street suit he was a gaunt rugged largeboned man of fifty with long legs and arms a pearshaped face and a drooping prewar moustache his specialty was spanish history and he had come all the way to hamilton from his cousins place in saskatchewan to enquire about some of doctor st peters sources introductions over it was the professors soninlaw louie marsellus who took sir edgar in hand he remembered having met in china a walter spilling who was it turned out a brother of sir edgar marsellus had also a brother there engaged in the silk trade they exchanged opinions on conditions of the orient while young mcgregor put on his hornrimmed spectacles and roamed restlessly up and down the library the two daughters sat near their mother listening to the talk about china mrs st peter was very fair pink and golda pale gold now that she was becoming a little grey the tints of her face and hair and lashes were so soft that one did not realize on first meeting her how very definitely and decidedly her features were cut under the smiling infusion of colour when she was annoyed or tired the lines became severe rosamond the elder daughter resembled her mother in feature though her face was heavier her colouring was altogether different dusky black hair deep dark eyes a soft white skin with rich brunette red in her cheeks and lips nearly everyone considered rosamond brilliantly beautiful her father though he was very proud of her demurred from the general opinion he thought her too tall with a rather awkward carriage she stooped a trifle and was wide in the hips and shoulders she had he sometimes remarked to her mother exactly the wide femur and flat shoulderblade of his old slabsided kanuck grandfather for a treehewer they were an asset but st peter was very critical most people saw only rosamonds smooth black head and white throat and the red of her curved lips that was like the duskiness of dark heavyscented roses kathleen the younger daughter looked even younger than she washad the slender undeveloped figure then very much in vogue she was pale with light hazel eyes and her hair was hazelcoloured with distinctly green glints to it to her father there was something very charming in the curious shadows her wide cheekbones cast over her cheeks and in the spirited tilt of her head her figure in profile he used to tell her looked just like an interrogation point mrs st peter frankly liked having a soninlaw who could tot up acquaintances with sir edgar from the soudan to alaska scott she saw was going to be sulky because sir edgar and marsellus were talking about things beyond his little circle of interests she made no effort to draw him into the conversation but let him prowl like a restless leopard among the books the professor was amiable but quiet when the second maid came to the door and signalled that dinner was readydinner was signalled not announcedmrs st peter took sir edgar and guided him to his seat at her right while the others found their usual places after they had finished the soup she had some difficulty in summoning the little maid to take away the plates and explained to her guest that the electric bell under the table wasnt connected as yetthey had been in the new house less than a week and the trials of building were not over oh then if i had happened along a fortnight ago i shouldnt have found you here but it must be very interesting building your own house and arranging it as you like he responded marsellus silenced during the soup came in with a warm smile and a slight shrug of the shoulders building is the word with us sir edgar myoh isnt it my wife and i are in the throes of it we are building a country house rather an ambitious affair out on the wooded shores of lake michigan perhaps you would like to run out in my car and see it what are your engagements for tomorrow i can take you out in half an hour and we can lunch at the country club we have a magnificent site primeval forest behind us and the lake in front with our own beachmy fatherinlaw you must know is a formidable swimmer weve been singularly fortunate in architecta young norwegian trained in paris hes doing us a norwegian manor house very harmonious with its setting just the right thing for rugged pine woods and high headlands sir edgar seemed most willing to make this excursion and allowed marsellus to fix an hour greatly to the surprise of mcgregor whose look at his wife implied that he entertained serious doubts whether this baronet with walrus moustaches amounted to much after all the engagement made louie turned to mrs st peter and wont you come too dearest you havent been out since we got our wonderful wroughtiron door fittings from chicago we found just the right sort of hinge and latch sir edgar and had all the others copied from it none of your colonial glass knobs for us mrs st peter sighed scott and kathleen had just glassknobbed their new bungalow throughout yet she knew louie didnt mean to hurt their feelingsit was his heedless enthusiasm that made him often say untactful things weve been extremely fortunate in getting all the little things right louie was gladly confiding to sir edgar theres really not a flaw in the conception i can say that because im a mere onlooker the whole things been done by the norwegian and my wife and mrs st peter and he put his hand down affectionately upon mrs st peters bare arm and weve named our place ive already ordered the house stationary no rosamond i wont keep our little secret any longer it will please your father as well as your mother we call our place outland sir edgar he dropped the announcement and drew back his motherinlaw rose to itspilling could scarcely be expected to understand how splendid louie a real inspiration yes isnt it i knew that would go to your hearts the professor had expressed his emotion only by lifting his heavy sharply uptwisted eyebrow let me explain sir edgar marsellus went on eagerly we have named our place for tom outland a brilliant young american scientist and inventor who was killed in flanders fighting with the foreign legion the second year of the war when he was barely thirty years of age before he dashed off to the front this youngster had discovered the principle of the outland vacuum worked out the construction of the bulkheaded vacuum that is revolutionizing aviation he had not only invented it but curiously enough for such a hotheaded fellow had taken pains to protect it he had no time to communicate his discovery or to commercialize itsimply bolted to the front and left the most important discovery of his time to take care of itself sir edgar fork arrested looked a trifle dazed am i to understand that you are referring to the inventor of the outland vacuum louie was delighted exactly that of course you would know all about it my wife was young outlands fianceacuteeis virtually his widow before he went to france he made a will in her favour he had no living relatives indeed toward the close of the war we began to sense the importance of what outland had been doing in his laboratoryi am an electrical engineer by profession we called in the assistance of experts and got the idea over from the laboratory to the trade the monetary returns have been and are of course large while louie paused long enough to have some intercourse with the roast before it was taken away sir edgar remarked that he himself had been in the air service during the war in the construction department and that it was most extraordinary to come thus by chance upon the genesis of the outland vacuum you see louie told him outland got nothing out of it but death and glory naturally we feel terribly indebted we feel its our first duty in life to use that money as he would have wishedweve endowed scholarships in his own university here and that sort of thing but our house we want to have as a sort of memorial to him we are going to transfer his laboratory there if the university will permitall the apparatus he worked with we have a room for his library and pictures when his brother scientists come to hamilton to look him up to get information about him as they are doing now already at outland they will find his books and instruments all the sources of his inspiration even rosamond murmured mcgregor his eyes upon his cool green salad he was struggling with a desire to shout to the britisher that marsellus had never so much as seen tom outland while he mcgregor had been his classmate and friend sir edgar was as much interested as he was mystified he had come here to talk about manuscripts shut up in certain mouldering monasteries in spain but he had almost forgotten them in the turn the conversation had taken he was genuinely interested in aviation and all its problems he asked few questions and his comments were almost entirely limited to the single exclamation oh but this from his lips could mean a great many things indifference sharp interrogation sympathetic interest the nervousness of a modest man on hearing disclosures of a delicately personal nature mcgregor before the others had finished dessert drew a big cigar from his pocket and lit it at one of the table candles as the horridest thing he could think of to do when they left the diningroom st peter who had scarcely spoken during dinner took sir edgars arm and said to his wife if you will excuse us my dear we have some technical matters to discuss leading his guest into the library he shut the door marsellus looked distinctly disappointed he stood gazing wistfully after them like a little boy told to go to bed louies eyes were vividly blue like hot sapphires but the rest of his face had little colourhe was a rather mackereltinted man only his eyes and his quick impetuous movements gave out the zest for life with which he was always bubbling there was nothing semitic about his countenance except his nosethat took the lead it was not at all an unpleasing feature but it grew out of his face with masterful strength wellrooted like a vigorous oaktree growing out of a hillside mrs st peter always concerned for louie asked him to come and look at the new rug in her bedroom this revived him he took her arm and they went upstairs together mcgregor was left with the two sisters outland outlandish he muttered while he fumbled about for an ashtray rosamond pretended not to hear him but the dusky red on her cheeks crept a little farther toward her ears remember we are leaving early scott said kathleen you have to finish your editorial tonight surely you dont make him work at night too rosamond asked doesnt he have to rest his brain sometimes humour is always better if its spontaneous oh thats the trouble with me scott assured her unless i keep my nose to the grindstone im too damned spontaneous and tell the truth and the public wont stand for it its not an editorial i have to finish its the daily prose poem i do for the syndicate for which i get twentyfive beans this is the motif   when your pocket is undermoneyed and your fancy is overgirled youll have to admit while youre cursing it its a mighty darned good old world   bang bang he threw his cigarend savagely into the fireplace he knew that rosamond detested his editorials and his jingles she had fastidious taste in literature like her motherthough he didnt think she had half the general intelligence of his wife she also now that she was tom outlands heir detested to hear sums of money mentioned especially small sums after the goodnights were said and they were outside the front door mcgregor seized his wifes elbow and rushed her down the walk to the gate where his ford was parked breaking out in her ear as they ran now what the hell is a virtual widow does he mean a virtuous widow or the reverseous bang bang     chapter 3   st peter awoke the next morning with the wish that he could be transported on his mattress from the new house to the old but it was sunday and on that day his wife always breakfasted with him there was no way out they would meet at compt when he reached the diningroom lillian was already at the table behind the percolator good morning godfrey i hope you had a good night her tone just faintly implied that he hadnt deserved one excellent and you i had a good conscience she smiled ruefully at him how can you let yourself be ungracious in your own house oh dear and i went to sleep happy in the belief that i hadnt said anything amiss the whole evening nor anything aright that i heard your disapproving silence can kill the life of any company it didnt seem to last night youre entirely wrong about marsellus he doesnt notice hes too polite to take notice but he feels it hes very sensitive under a wellschooled impersonal manner st peter laughed nonsense lillian if he were he couldnt pick up a dinner party and walk off with it as he almost always does i dont mind when its our dinner but i hate seeing him do it in other peoples houses be fair godfrey you know that if youd once begun to talk about your work in spain louie would have followed it up with enthusiasm nobody is prouder of you than he thats why i kept quiet support can be too ablecertainly too fluent there you are the dog in the manger you wont let him discuss your affairs and you are annoyed when he talks about his own i admit i cant bear it when he talks about outland as his affair i mean tom of course not their confounded place this calling it after him passes my comprehension and rosamonds standing for it its brazen impudence mrs st peter frowned pensively i knew you wouldnt like it but they were so pleased about it and their motives are so generous hang it outland doesnt need their generosity theyve got everything he ought to have had and the least they can do is to be quiet about it and not convert his very bones into a personal asset it all comes down to this my dear one likes the florid style or one doesnt you yourself used not to like it and will you give me some more coffee please she refilled his cup and handed it across the table nice hands he murmured looking critically at them as he took it always such nice hands thank you i dislike floridity when it is beaten up to cover the lack of something to take the place of something i never disliked it when it came from exuberance then it isnt floridness its merely strong colour very well some people dont care for strong colour it fatigues them he folded his napkin now i must be off to my desk not quite yet you never have time to talk to me just when did it begin godfrey in the history of mannersthat convention that if a man were pleased with his wife or his house or his success he shouldnt say so frankly mrs st peter spoke thoughtfully as if she had considered this matter before oh it goes back a long way i rather think it began in the age of chivalryking arthurs knights whoever it was lived in that time some feeling grew up that a man should do fine deeds and not speak of them and that he shouldnt speak the name of his lady but sing of her as a phyllis or a nicolette its a nice idea reserve about ones deepest feelings keeps them fresh the oriental peoples didnt have an age of chivalry they didnt need one lillian observed and this reserveit becomes in itself ostentatious a vainglorious vanity oh my dear all is vanity i dont dispute that now i must really go and i wish i could play the game as well as you do i have no enthusiasm for being a fatherinlaw its you who keep the ball rolling i fully appreciate that perhaps mused his wife as he rose its because you didnt get the soninlaw you wanted and yet he was highly coloured too the professor made no reply to this lillian had been fiercely jealous of tom outland as he left the house he was reflecting that people who are intensely in love when they marry and who go on being in love always meet with something which suddenly or gradually makes a difference sometimes it is the children or the grubbiness of being poor sometimes a second infatuation in their own case it had been curiously enough his pupil tom outland st peter had met his wife in paris when he was but twentyfour and studying for his doctorate she too was studying there french people thought her an english girl because of her gold hair and fair complexion with her really radiant charm she had a very interesting mindbut it was quite wrong to call it mind the connotation was false what she had was a richly endowed nature that responded strongly to life and art and very vehement likes and dislikes which were often quite out of all proportion to the trivial object or person that aroused them before his marriage and for years afterward lillians prejudices her divinations about people and art always instinctive and unexplained but nearly always right were the most interesting things in st peters life when he accepted almost the first position offered him in order to marry at once and came to take the chair of european history at hamilton he was thrown upon his wife for mental companionship most of his colleagues were much older than he but they were not his equals either in scholarship or in experience of the world the only other man in the faculty who was carrying on important research work was doctor crane the professor of physics st peter saw a good deal of him though outside his specialty he was uninterestinga narrowminded man and painfully unattractive years ago crane had begun to suffer from a malady which in time proved incurable and which now sent him up for an operation periodically st peter had had no friend in hamilton of whom lillian could possibly be jealous until tom outland came along so well fitted by nature and early environment to help him with his work on the spanish adventurers when he had almost reached his old house and his study the professor remembered that he really must have an understanding with his landlord or the place would be rented over his head he turned and went down into another part of the city by the car shops where only workmen lived and found his landlords little toy house set on a hillside over a basement faced up with red brick and covered with hop vines old appelhoff was sitting on a bench before his door making a broom raising broom corn was one of his economies beside him was his dachshund bitch minna st peter explained that he wanted to stay on in the empty house and would pay the full rent each month so irregular a project annoyed appelhoff i like fine to oblige you professor but dey is several parties looking at de house already an i dont like to lose a years rent for maybe a few months oh thats all right fred ill take it for the year to simplify matters i want to finish my new book before i move fred still looked uneasy i better see de insurance man eh it says for purposes of domestic dwelling he wont object lets have a look at your garden what a fine crop of apples and sickle pears you have i dont like dem trees what dont bear noting said the old man with sly humour remembering the professors glistening barren shrubs and the good ground wasted behind his stucco wall how about your lindentrees oh dem flowers is awful good for de headache you dont look as if you were subject to it fred not me but my woman always had pretty lonesome without her appelhoff i miss her professor but i aint just lonesome the old man rubbed his bristly chin my minna here is most like a person and den i got so many tings to tink about have you pleasant things i hope well all kinds when i was young in de old country i had it hard to git my wife at all an i never had time to tink when i come to dis country i had to work so turrible hard on dat farm to make crops an pay debts dat i was like a horse now i have it easy an i take time to tink about all dem tings st peter laughed we all come to it applehoff thats one thing im renting your house for to have room to think good morning crossing the public park on his way back to the old house he espied his professional rival and enemy professor horace langtry taking a sunday morning strollvery well got up in english clothes he had brought back from his customary summer in london with a bowler hat of unusual block and a hornhandled walkingstick in twenty years the two men had scarcely had speech with each other beyond a stiff good morning when langtry first came to the university he looked hardly more than a boy with curly brown hair and such a fresh complexion that the students called him lily langtry his round pink cheeks and round eyes and round chin made him look rather like a baby grown big all these years had made little difference except that his curls were now quite grey his rosy cheeks even rosier and his mouth dropped a little at the corners so that he looked like a baby suddenly grown old and rather cross about it seeing st peter the younger man turned abruptly into a side alley but the professor overtook him good morning langtry these elms are becoming real trees at last theyve changed a good deal since we first came here doctor langtry moved his rosy chin sidewise over his high double collar good morning doctor st peter i really dont remember much about the trees they seem to be doing well now st peter stepped abreast of him there have been many changes langtry and not all of them are good dont you notice a great difference in the student body as a whole in the new crop that comes along every year nowhow different they are from the ones of our early years here the smooth chin turned again and the other professor of european history blinked in just what respect oh in the allembracing respect of quality we have hosts of students but theyre a common sort perhaps i cant say ive noticed it the air between the two colleagues was not thawing out any a churchbell rang langtry started hopefully you must excuse me doctor st peter i am on my way to service the professor gave it up with a shrug all right all right langtry as you will quelle folie langtry half turned back hesitated on the ball of his suddenly speeding foot and said with faultless politeness i beg your pardon st peter waved his hand with a gesture of negation and detained the churchgoer no longer he sauntered along slackly through the hot september sunshine wondering why langtry didnt see the absurdity of their long grudge they had always been directly opposed in matters of university policy until it had almost become a part of their professional duties to outwit and cramp each other when young langtry first came there his specialty was supposed to be american history his uncle was president of the board of regents and very influential in state politics the institution had to look to him indeed to get its financial appropriations passed by the legislature langtry was a tory in his point of view and was considered very english in his tone and manner his lectures were dull and the students didnt like him every inducement was offered to make his courses popular liberal credits were given for collateral reading a student could read almost anything that had ever been written in the united states and get credit for it in american history he could charge up the time spent in perusing the scarlet letter to colonial history and tom sawyer to the missouri compromise it was said st peter openly criticized these lax methods both to the faculty and to the regents naturally madame langtry paid him out during the professors second sabbatical year in spain horace and his uncle together very nearly got his department away from him they worked so quietly that it was only at the eleventh hour that st peters old students throughout the state got wind of what was going on dropped their various businesses and professions for a few days and came up to the capital in dozens and saved his place for him the opposition had been so formidable that when it came time for his third year away the professor had not dared ask for it but had taken an extension of his summer vacation instead the fact that he was carrying on another line of work than his lectures and was publishing books that werent strictly textbooks had been used against him by langtrys uncle as langtry felt that the unpopularity of his course was due to his subject a new chair was created for him there couldnt be two heads in european history so the board of regents made for him a chair of renaissance history or as st peter said a renaissance chair of history of late years for reasons that had not much to do with his lectures langtry had prospered better to the new generations of country and village boys now pouring into the university in such large numbers langtry had become in a curious way an instructor in mannerswhat is called an influence to the footballplaying farmer boy who had a good allowance but didnt know how to dress or what to say langtry looked like a short cut he had several times taken parties of undergraduates to london for the summer and they had come back wonderfully brushed up he introduced a very popular fraternity into the university and its members looked after his interests as did its affiliated sorority his standing on the faculty was now quite as good as st peters own and the professor wondered what langtry still had to be sore about what was the use of keeping up the feud they had both come there young men fighting for their places and their lives now they were not very young any more they would neither of them probably ever hold a better position couldnt langtry see it was a draw that they had both been beaten     chapter 4   on monday afternoon st peter mounted to his study and lay down on the boxcouch tired out with his day at the university the first few weeks of the year were very fatiguing for him there were so many exhausting things besides his lectures and all the new students long faculty meetings in which almost no one was ever frank and always the old fight to keep up the standard of scholarship to prevent the younger professors who had a sharp eye to their own interests from farming the whole institution out to athletics and to the agricultural and commercial schools favoured and fostered by the state legislature the september heat too was hard on him he wanted to be out at the lake every dayit was never so fine as in late september he was lying with closed eyes resting his mind on the picture of intense autumnblue water when he heard a tap at the door and his daughter rosamond entered very handsome in a silk suit of a vivid shade of lilac admirably suited to her complexion and showing that in the colour of her cheeks there was actually a tone of warm lavender in that low room she seemed very tall indeed a little out of drawing as to her fathers eye she so often did usually however people were aware only of her rich complexion her curving unresisting mouth and mysterious eyes tom outland had seen nothing else and he was a young man who saw a great deal am i interrupting something important papa no not at all my dear sit down on his writingtable she caught a glimpse of pages in a handwriting not hisa script she knew very well not much choice of chairs is there she smiled papa i dont like to have you working in a place like this its not fitting much easier than to break in a new room rosie a workroom should be like an old shoe no matter how shabby its better than a new one thats really what i came to see you about rosamond traced the edge of a hole in the matting with the tip of her lilac sunshade wont you let me build you a little study in the back yard of the new house i have such good ideas for it and you would have no bother about it at all oh thank you rosamond its most awfully nice of you to think of it but keep it just an ideaits better so lots of things are for the present ill plod on here its absurd but it suits me habit is such a big part of work with augustas old things lying about and those dusty old forms why didnt she at least get those out of your way oh they have a right here by long tenure its their room too i dont want to come upon them lying in some dumpheap on the road to the lake they remind me of the times when you were little girls and your first party frocks used to hang on them at night when i worked rosamond smiled unconvinced papa dont joke with me ive come to talk about something serious and its very difficult you know im a little afraid of you she dropped her shadowy bewitching eyes afraid of me never oh yes i am when youre sarcastic you mustnt be today please louie and i have often talked this over we feel strongly about it hes often been on the point of blurting out with it but ive curbed him you dont always approve of louie and me of course it was only louies energy and technical knowledge that ever made toms discovery succeed commercially but we dont feel that we ought to have all the returns from it we think you ought to let us settle an income on you so that you could give up your university work and devote all your time to writing and research that is what tom would have wanted st peter rose quickly with the light supple spring he had when he was very nervous crossed to the window wide on its hook and half closed it my dear daughter he said decisively when he had turned round to her i couldnt possibly take any of outlands money but why not you were the best friend he had in the world he owed more to you than to anyone else and he hated having you hampered by teaching he admired your mind and nothing would have pleased him more than helping you to do the work you do better than anyone else if he were alive that would be one of the first things he would use this money for but he is not alive and there was no word about me in his will and so there is nothing to build your pretty theory upon its wonderfully nice of you and louie and im very pleased you know but tom was so impractical father he never thought it would mean more than a liberal dress allowance for me if he thought at all i dont knowhe never spoke to me about it st peter smiled quizzically im not so sure about his impracticalness when he was working on that gas he once remarked to me that there might be a fortune in it to be sure he didnt wait to find out whether there was a fortune but that had to do with quite another side of him yes i think he knew his idea would make money and he wanted you to have it with him or without him the young womans face grew troubled even if i married he wanted you to have whatever would make you happy she sighed luxuriously louie has done that the only thing that troubles me is i feel you ought to have some of this money that he would wish it he was so full of gratitude felt that he owed you so much her father again rose with that guarded nervous movement once and for all rosamond understand that he owed me no more than i owed him nothing hurts me so much as to have any member of my family talk as if we had done something fine for that young man brought him out produced him in a lifetime of teaching ive encountered just one remarkable mind but for that id consider my good years largely wasted and there can be no question of money between me and tom outland i cant explain just how i feel about it but it would somehow damage my recollections of him would make that episode in my life commonplace like everything else and that would be a great loss to me im purely selfish in refusing your offer my friendship with outland is the one thing i will not have translated into the vulgar tongue his daughter looked perplexed and a little resentful sometimes she murmured i think you feel i oughtnt to have taken it either you had no choice for you it was settled by his own hand your bond with him was social and it follows the laws of society and they are based on property mine wasnt and there was no material clause in it he empowered you to carry out all his wishes and i realize that you have responsibilitiesbut none toward me there is rodney blake of course if he should ever turn up you keep up some search for him louie attends to it he has investigated and rejected several impostors then of course there are other friends of toms the cranes for instance rosamonds face grew hard i wont bother you about the cranes papa we will attend to them mrs crane is a common creature and she is advised by that dreadful shyster brother of hers homer bright you know what he is oh yes he was about the greatest bluffer i ever had in my classes rosamond had risen to go i want you to be awfully happy daughter st peter went on and tom did its only young people like you and louie who can get any fun out of money and there is enough to cover the fine the almost imaginary obligations you wont be sorry if you are generous with people like the cranes thank you papa i shant forget rosamond went down the narrow stairway leaving behind her a faint fresh odour of lavender and orrisroot and her father lay down again on the boxcouch a hint about the cranes will be enough he was thinking he didnt in the least understand his older daughter not that he pretended to understand kathleen either but he usually knew how she would feel about things and she had always seemed to need his protection more than rosamond when she was a student at the university he used sometimes to see her crossing the campus alone her head and shoulders lowered against the wind her muff beside her face her narrow skirt clinging close there was something too plucky too i cangoitalone about her quick step and jaunty little head he didnt like it it gave him a sudden pang he would always call to her and catch up with her and make her take his arm and be docile she had been much quicker at her lessons than rosie and very clever at watercolour portrait sketches she had done several really good likenesses of her fatherone at least was the man himself with her mother she had no luck she tried again and again but the face was always hard the upper lip longer than it seemed in life the nose long and severed and she made something cold and plasterlike of lillians beautiful complexion no i dont see mamma like that she used to say throwing out her chin of course i dont it just comes like that she had done many heads of her sister all very sentimental and curiously false though louie marsellus protested to them her drawingteacher at the university had urged kathleen to go to chicago and study in the life classes at the art institute but she said resolutely no i cant really do anybody but papa and i cant make a living painting him the only unusual thing about kitty her father used to tell his friends is that she doesnt think herself a bit unusual nowdays the girls in my classes who have a spark of aptitude for anything seem to think themselves remarkable though wilfulness was implied in the line of her figure in the way she sometimes threw out her chin kathleen had never been deaf to reasoning deaf to her father but once and that was when shortly after rosamonds engagement to tom she announced that she was going to marry scott mcgregor scott was young was just getting a start as a journalist and his salary was not large enough for two people to live upon that fact the st peters thought would act as a brake upon the impetuous young couple but soon after they were engaged scott began to do his daily prose poem for a newspaper syndicate it was a success from the start and increased his earnings enough to enable him to marry the professor had expected a better match for kitty he was no snob and he liked scott and trusted him but he knew that scott had a usual sort of mind and kitty had flashes of something quite different her father thought a more interesting man would make her happier there was no holding her back however and the curious part of it was that after the very first her mother supported her st peter had a vague suspicion that this was somehow on rosamonds account more than on kathleens lillian always worked things out for rosamond yet at the time he couldnt see how kathleens marriage would benefit rosie rosie is like your second self he once declared to his wife but you never pampered yourself at her age as you do her     chapter 5   it was an intense september noonwarm windy golden with the smell of ripe grapes and drying vines in the air and the lake rolling blue on the horizon scott mcgregor going into the west corner of the university campus caught sight of mrs st peter just ahead of him walking in the same direction he ran and caught up with her hello lillian going in to see the professor so am i i want him to go swimming with meim cutting work shall we drop in and hear the end of his lecture or sit down here on the bench in the sun we can go quietly to the door and listen if its not interesting we can come back and sit down for a chat good i came early to overhear a bit this is the hour hes with his seniors isnt it they entered and went along the hall until they came to number 17 the door was ajar and at the moment one of the students was speaking when he finished they heard the professor reply to him no miller i dont myself think much of science as a phase of human development it has given us a lot of ingenious toys they take our attention away from the real problems of course and since the problems are insoluble i suppose we ought to be grateful for distraction but the fact is the human mind the individual mind has always been made more interesting by dwelling on the old riddles even if it makes nothing of them science hasnt given us any new amazements except of the superficial kind we get from witnessing dexterity and sleightofhand it hasnt given us any richer pleasures as the renaissance did nor any new sinsnot one indeed it takes our old ones away its the laboratory not the lamb of god that taketh away the sins of the world youll agree there is not much thrill about a physiological sin we were better off when even the prosaic matter of taking nourishment could have the magnificence of a sin i dont think you help people by making their conduct of no importanceyou impoverish them as long as every man and woman who crowded into the cathedrals on easter sunday was a principal in a gorgeous drama with god glittering angels on one side and the shadows of evil coming and going on the other life was a rich thing the king and the beggar had the same chance at miracles and great temptations and revelations and thats what makes men happy believing in the mystery and importance of their own individual lives it makes us happy to surround our creature needs and bodily instincts with as much pomp and circumstance as possible art and religion they are the same thing in the end of course have given man the only happiness he has ever had moses learned the importance of that in the egyptian court and when he wanted to make a population of slaves into an independent people in the shortest possible time he invented elaborate ceremonials to give them a feeling of dignity and purpose every act had some imaginative end the cutting of the finger nails was a religious observance the christian theologians went over the books of the law like great artists getting splendid effects by excision they reset the stage with more space and mystery throwing all the light upon a few sins of great dramatic valueonly seven you remember and of those only three that are perpetually enthralling with the theologians came the cathedralbuilders the sculptors and glassworkers and painters they might without sacrilege have changed the prayer a little and said thy will be done in art as it is in heaven how can it be done anywhere else as it is in heaven but i think the hour is up you might tell me next week miller what you think science has done for us besides making us very comfortable as the young men filed out of the room mrs st peter and mcgregor went in i came over to get you to go to the electricians with me godfrey but i wont make you scott wants you to run out to the lake and its such a fine day you really should go cars outside well just drop lillian at the house doctor and you can pick up your bathingsuit we heard part of your lecture by the way how you get by the methodists is still a mystery to me i wish he would get into trouble scott said lillian as they left the building i wish he wouldnt talk to those fatfaced boys as if they were intelligent beings you cheapen yourself godfrey it makes me a little ashamed i was rather rambling on today im sorry you happened along theres a fellow in that lot tod miller who isnt slow and he excites me to controversy all the same murmured his wife its hardly dignified to think aloud in such company its in rather bad taste thank you for the tip lillian i wont do it again it took scott only twenty minutes to get out to the lake he drew up at the bit of beach st peter had bought for himself years before a little triangle of sand running out into the water with a bathhouse and seven shaggy pinetrees on it scott had to fuss with the car and the professor was undressed and in the water before him when mcgregor was ready to go in his fatherinlaw was some distance out swimming with an overarm stroke his head and shoulders well out of the water he wore on his head a rubber visor of a kind he always brought home from france in great numbers this one was vermilion and was like a continuation of his fleshhis arms and back were burned a deep terracotta from a summer in the lake his head and powerful reaching arms made a strong red pattern against the purple blue of the water the visor was picturesquehis head looked sheathed and small and intensely alive like the heads of the warriors on the parthenon frieze in their tight archaic helmets by five oclock st peter and mcgregor were dressed and lying on the sand their overcoats wrapped about them smoking suddenly scott began to chuckle oh professor you know your english friend sir edgar spilling the day after i met him at your house he came up to my office at the herald to get some facts youd been too modest to give him when he was leaving he stood and looked at one of these motto cards i have over my desk dont knock and said may i ask why you dont have that notice on the outside of your door i didnt observe any other way of getting in they never get wise do they he really went out to see marsellus placeseemed interested doctor are you going to let them call that place after tom my dear boy how can i prevent it well you surely dont like the idea do you the professor lit another cigarette and was a long while about it when he had got it going he turned on his elbow and looked at mcgregor scott you must see that i cant make suggestions to louie hes perfectly consistent hes a great deal more generous and publicspirited than i am and my preferences would be enigmatical to him i cant either very gracefully express myself to you about his affairs i get you sorry he riles me so i always say it shant occur next time but it does scott took out his pipe and lay silent for a time looking at the gold glow burning on the water and on the wings of the gulls as they flew by his expression was wistful rather mournful he was a goodlooking fellow with sunburned blond hair splendid teeth attractive eyes that usually frowned a little unless he was laughing outright a small prettily cut mouth restless at the corners there was something moody and discontented about his face the professor had a great deal of sympathy for him scott was too good for his work he had been delighted when his daily poem and his uplift editorials first proved successful because that enabled him to marry now he could sell as many goodcheer articles as he had time to write on any subject and he loathed doing them scott had early picked himself out to do something very fine and he felt that the was wasting his life and his talents the new group of poets made him angry when a new novel was discussed seriously by his friends he was perfectly miserable st peter knew that the poor boy had seasons of desperate unhappiness his disappointed vanity ate away at his vitals like the spartan boys wolf and only the deep lines in his young forehead and the twitching at the corners of his mouth showed that he suffered not long ago when the students were giving an historical pageant to commemorate the deeds of an early french explorer among the great lakes they asked st peter to do a picture for them and he had arranged one which amused him very much though it had nothing to do with the subject he posed his two sonsinlaw in a tapestryhung tent for a conference between richard plantagenet and the saladin before the walls of jerusalem marsellus in a green dressinggown and turban was seated at a table with a chart his hands extended in reasonable patient argument the plantagenet was standing his plumed helmet is his hand his square yellow head haughtily erect his unthoughtful brows fiercely frowning his lips curled and his fresh face full of arrogance the tableau had received no special notice and mrs st peter had said dryly that she was afraid nobody saw his little joke but the professor liked his picture and he thought it quite fair to both the young men     chapter 6   the professor happened to come home earlier than usual one bright october afternoon he left the walk and cut across the turf intending to enter by the open french window but he paused a moment outside to admire the scene within the drawingroom was full of autumn flowers dahlias and wild asters and goldenrod the redgold sunlight lay in bright puddles on the thick blue carpet made hazy aureoles about the stuffed blue chairs there was in the room as he looked through the window a rich intense effect of autumn something that presented october much more sharply and sweetly to him than the coloured maples and the asterbordered paths by which he had come home it struck him that the seasons sometimes gain by being brought into the house just as they gain by being brought into painting and into poetry the hand fastidious and bold which selected and placedit was that which made the difference in nature there is no selection in a corner beside the steaming brass teakettle sat lillian and louie a little lacquer table between them bending it seemed over a casket of jewels lillian held up lovingly in her fingers a greengold necklace evidently an old one without stones of course emeralds would be beautiful louie but they seem a little out of scaleto belong to a different scheme of life than any you and rosamond can live here you arent after all outrageously rich when would she wear them at home dearest with me at our own dinnertable at outland i like the idea of their being out of scale ive never given her any jewels ive waited all this time to give her these to me her name spells emeralds mrs st peter smiled easily persuaded youll never be able to keep them youll show them to her oh no i wont they are to stay at the jewellers in chicago until we all go down for the birthday party thats another secret we have to keep we have such lots of them he bent over her hand and kissed it with warmth st peter swung in over the window rail that is always the cue for the husband to enter isnt it whats this about chicago louie he sat down and marsellus brought him some tea lingering beside his chair it must be a secret from rosie but you see it happens that the date of your lecture engagement at the university of chicago is coincident with her birthday so i have planned that we shall all go down together and among other diversions we shall attend your lectures the professors eyebrows rose busmans holiday for the ladies i should say but not for me remember i wasnt in your classes like scott and outland id give a good deal if id had the chance louie said somewhat plaintively so you must make it up to me come if you wish lectures seem to me a rather grim treat louie not to me with a wink of encouragement ill go on to boston with you next winter when you give the lowell lectures would you really next years a long way off now i must get clean ive been working in my otherhouse garden and im scarcely fit to have tea with a beautiful lady and a smartly dressed gentleman what am i to do about that garden in the end lillian destroy it or leave it to the mercy of the next tenants as he went upstairs he turned at the bend of the staircase and looked back at them again bending over their little box mrs st peter was wearing the white silk crecircpe that had been the most successful of her summer dresses and an orchid velvet ribbon about her shining hair she wouldnt have made herself look quite so well if louie hadnt been coming he reflected or was it that he wouldnt have noticed it if louie hadnt been there a man long accustomed to admire his wife in general seldom pauses to admire her in a particular gown or attitude unless his attention is directed to her by the appreciative gaze of another man lillians coquetry with her sonsinlaw amused him he hadnt foreseen it and he found it rather the most piquant and interesting thing about having married daughters it had begun with scottthe younger sister was married before the elder st peter had thought that scott mcgregor was the sort of fellow lillian always found tiresome but no within a few weeks after kathleens marriage arch and confidential relations began to be evident between them even now when louie was so much in the foreground and scott was touchy and jealous lillian was very tactful and patient with him with louie lillian seemed to be launching into a new career and godfrey began to think that he understood his own wife very little he would have said that she would feel about louie just as he did would have cultivated him as a stranger in the town because he was so unusual and exotic but without in the least wishing to adopt anyone so foreign into the family circle she had always been fastidious to an unreasonable degree about small niceties of deportment she could never forgive poor tom outland for the angle at which he sometimes held a cigar in his mouth or for the fact that he never learned to eat salad with ease at the dinnertable if tom forgetting himself in talk sometimes dropped back into railroad lunchcounter ways and pushed his plate away from him when he had finished a course lillians face would become positively cruel in its contempt irregularities of that sort put her all on edge but louie could hurry audibly through his soup or kiss her resoundingly on the cheek at a faculty reception and she seemed to like it yes with her sonsinlaw she had begun the game of being a woman all over again she dressed for them planned for them schemed in their interests she had begun to entertain more than for years pastthe new house made a plausible pretextand to use her influence and charm in the little anxious social world of hamilton she was intensely interested in the success and happiness of these two young men lived in their careers as she had once done in his it was splendid st peter told himself she wasnt going to have to face a stretch of boredom between being a young woman and being a young grandmother she was less intelligent and more sensible than he had thought her when godfrey came down stairs ready for dinner louie was gone he walked up to the chair where his wife was reading and took her hand my dear he said quite delicately i wish you could keep louie from letting his name go up for the arts and letters its not safe yet hes not been here long enough theyre a fussy little bunch and he ought to wait until they know him better you mean someone will blackball him do you really think so but the country club yes lillian the country club is a big affair and needs money the arts and letters is a little group of fellows and as i said fussy scott belongs said mrs st peter rebelliously did he tell you no he didnt and i shall not tell you who did but if youre tactful you can save louies feelings mrs st peter closed her book without glancing down at it a new interest shone in her eyes and made them look quite through and beyond her husband i must see what i can do with scott she murmured st peter turned away to hide a smile an old student of his a friend who belonged to the outland period had told him laughingly that he was sure scott would blackball marsellus if his name ever came to the vote you know scott is a kid in some things the friend had said hes a little sore at marsellus and says a secret ballot is the only way he can ever get him where it wouldnt hurt mrs st peter while the professor was eating his soup he studied his wifes face in the candlelight it had changed so much since he found her laughing with louie and especially since he had dropped the hint about the arts and letters it had become he thought too hard for the orchid velvet in her hair her upper lip had grown longer and stiffened as it always did when she encountered opposition well he reflected it will be interesting to see what she can do with scott that will make rather a test case     chapter 7   early in november there was a picturesque snowstorm and that day kathleen telephoned her father at the university asking him to stop on his way home in the afternoon and help her to decide upon some new furs as he approached mcgregors spickandspan bungalow at four oclock he saw louies piercearrow standing in front with ned the chauffeur and gardener in the drivers seat just then rosamond came out of the bungalow alone and down the path to the sidewalk without seeing her father he noticed a singularly haughty expression on her face her brows drawn together over her nose the curl of her lips was handsome but terrifying he observed also something he had not seen beforea coat of soft purplegrey fur that quite disguised the wide slightly stooping shoulders he regretted in his truly beautiful daughter he called to her very much interested wait a minute rosie ive not seen that before its extraordinarily becoming he stroked his daughters sleeve with evident pleasure you know these things with a kind of lurking purple and lavender in them are splendid for you they make your colour prettier than ever its only lately youve begun to wear them louies taste i suppose of course he selects all my things for me said rosamond proudly well he does a good job he knows whats right for you st peter continued to look her up and down with satisfaction and kathleen is getting new furs you were advising her she didnt mention it to me rosamond replied in a guarded voice no and what do you call this what beast he asked ingenuously again stroking the fur with his bare hand its taupe oh moleskin he drew back a little couldnt be better for your complexion and is it warm very warmand so light i see i see he took rosamonds arm and escorted her to her car give louie my compliments on his choice the motor glided awayhe wished he could escape as quickly and noiselessly for he was a coward but he had a feeling that kathleen was watching him from behind the sash curtains he went up to the door and made a long and thorough use of the footscraper before he tapped on the glass kathleen let him in she was very pale even her lips which were always pink like the inside of a white shell were without colour neither of them mentioned the justdeparted guest have you been out in the park kitty this is a pretty little storm perhaps youll walk over to the old house with me presently he talked soothingly while he took off his coat and rubbers and now for the furs kathleen went slowly into her bedroom she was gone a great whileperhaps ten actual minutes when she came back the rims of her eyes were red she carried four large pasteboard boxes tied together with twine st peter sprang up took the parcel and began untying the string he opened the first and pulled out a brown stole what is it mink no its hudson bay sable very pretty he put the collar round her neck and drew back to look at it but after a sharp struggle kathleen broke down she threw off the fur and buried her face in a fresh handkerchief im so sorry daddy but its no use today i dont want any furs really she spoils everything for me oh my dear my dear you hurt me terribly st peter put his hands tenderly on her soft hazelcoloured hair face it squarely kitty you must not you cannot be envious its selfdestruction i cant help it father i am envious i dont think i would be if she let me alone but she comes here with her magnificence and takes the life out of all our poor little things everybody knows shes rich why does she have to keep rubbing it in but kitty dear you wouldnt have her go home and change her coat before coming to see you oh its not that father its everything you know we were never jealous of each other at home i was always proud of her good looks and good taste its not her clothes its a feeling she has inside her when she comes toward me i feel hate coming toward me like a snakes hate st peter wiped his moist forehead he was suffering with her as if she had been in physical anguish we cant dear we cant in this world let ourselves think of thingsof comparisonslike that we are all too susceptible to ugly suggestions if rosamond has a grievance its because youve been untactful about louie even if i have why should she be so revengeful does she think nobody else calls him a jew does she think its a secret i dont mind being called a gentile its all in the way its done you know kitty and youve shown that you were a little bored with all their new things now havent you ive shown that i dont like the way she overdresses i suppose i would never have believed that rosie could do anything in such bad taste while she is here among her old friends she ought to dress like the rest of us but doesnt she it seems to me her things look about like yours oh father youre so simple and mother is very careful not to enlighten you we go to the guild to sew for the mission fund and rosie comes in in a handmade french frock that cost more than all our dresses put together but if hers are no prettier what does it matter how much they cost he was watching kathleen fearfully her pale skin had taken on a greenish tingethere was no doubt about it he had never happened to see that change occur in a face before and he had never realized to what an ugly painful transformation the common phrase green with envy referred oh foolish they are prettier though you may not see it its not just the clothesshe looked at him intently and her eyes in their reddened rims expanded and cleared its everything when we were at home rosamond was a kind of ideal to me what she thought about anything decided it for me but shes entirely changed shes become louie indeed shes worse than louie he and all this money have ruined her oh daddy why didnt you and professor crane get to work and stop all this before it began you were to blame you knew that tom had left something that was worth a lot both of you why didnt you do something you let it lie there in cranes laboratory for thisthis marsellus to come along and exploit until he almost thinks its his own idea things might have turned out the same anyway her father protested whatever the process earned was rosamonds i wasnt in the mood to struggle with manufacturers i know nothing of such things and crane needs every ounce of his strength for his own experiments he doesnt care anything but the extent of space hed better have taken a few days off and saved his friends reputation tom trusted him with everything its too foolish that poor man being cut to pieces by surgeons all the time and picking up the little thats left of himself and bothering about the limitations of spacemuch good theyll do him st peter rose took both of his daughters hands and stood laughing at her come now you have more brains than that kitty it happens you do understand that whatever poor crane can find out about space is more good to him than all the money the marselluses will ever have but are you implying that if crane and i had developed toms discovery we might have kept rosie and her money in the family for ourselves kathleen threw up her head oh i dont want her money exactly nor do i and we mustnt behave as if we did want it if you permit yourself to be envious of rosie youll be very foolish and very unhappy the professor walked away across the snowy park with a tired step he was heavyhearted for kathleen he had a special kind of affection perhaps it was because he had had to take care of her for one whole summer when she was little just as mrs st peter was ready to start for colorado with the children the younger one developed whoopingcough and had to be left at home with her father he had opportunity to observe all her ways she was only six but he found her a squaredealing dependable little creature they worked out a satisfactory plan of life together she was to play in the garden all morning and was not on any account to disturb him in his study after lunch he would take her to the lake or the woods or he would read to her at home she took pride in keeping her part of the contract one day when he came out of his study at noon he found her sitting on the third floor stairs just outside his door with the arnica bottle in one hand and the fingers of the other puffed up like wee pink sausages a bee had stung her in the garden and she had waited half the morning for sympathy she was very independent and would tug at her leggings or overshoes a great while before she asked for help when they were little girls kathleen adored her older sister and liked to wait on her was always more excited about rosies new dresses and winter coat than about her own this attachment had lasted even after they were grown st peter had never seen any change in it until rosamond announced her engagement to louie marsellus then all at once kathleen seemed to be done with her sister her father believed she couldnt forgive rosies forgetting tom so quickly it was dark when the professor got back to the old house and sat down at his writingtable he would have an hour on his notes he told himself in spite of families and fortunes and he had it but when he looked up from his writing as the angelus was ringing two faces at once rose in the shadows outside the yellow circle of his lamp the handsome face of his older daughter surrounded by violetdappled fur with a cruel upper lip and scornful halfclosed eyes as she had approached her car that afternoon before she saw him and kathleen her square little chin set so fiercely her white cheeks actually becoming green under her swollen eyes he couldnt believe it he rose quickly and went to his one window opened it wider and stood looking at the dark clump of pinetrees that told where the physics building stood a sharp pain clutched his heart was it for this the light in outlands laboratory used to burn so far into the night     chapter 8   the following week st peter went to chicago to give his lectures he had engaged rooms for himself and lillian at a quiet hotel near the university the marselluses went down by the same train and they all alighted at the station together in a raging snowstorm the st peters were to have tea with louie at the blackstone before going to their own quarters tea was served in louies suite on the lake front with a fine view of the falling snow from the windows the professor was in a genial mood he was glad to be in a big city again in a luxurious hotel and especially pleased to be able to sit in comfort and watch the storm over the water how snug you are here louie this is really very nice he said turning back from the window when rosamond called him louie came and put both hands on st peters shoulders exclaiming delightedly and do you like these rooms sir well im glad for theyre yours rosie and i are farther down the corridor not a word its all arranged you are our guests for this engagement we wont have our great scholar staying off in some grimy place on the south side we want him where we can keep an eye on him louie was so warm with his plan that the professor could only express satisfaction and our luggage its on the way i cancelled your reservations and did everything in order now have your tea but not too much you dine early you have an engagement for tonight you and dearest are going to the operaoh not with us we have other fish to fry you are going off alone very well louie and what are they giving tonight mignon it will remind you of your student days in paris it will i always had abonnement at the opeacutera comique and mignon came round frequently its one of my favourites i thought so louie kissed both the ladies to express his satisfaction the professor had forgotten his scruples about accepting lavish hospitalities he was really very glad to have windows on the lake and not to have to go away to another hotel after the marselluses went to their own apartment he remarked to his wife while he unpacked his bag that it was much more convenient to be on the same floor with louie and rosamond much better than cabbing across chicago to meet them all the time isnt it at eight oclock he and his wife were in their places in the auditorium the overture brought a smile to his lips and a gracious mood to his heart the music seemed extraordinarily fresh and genuine still it might grow oldfashioned he told himself but never old surely while there was any youth left in men it was an expression of youththat and no more with the sweetness and foolishness the lingering accent the heavy stressesthe delicacy toobelonging to that time after the entrance of the hero lillian leaned toward him and whispered am i overcredulous he looks to me exactly like the pictures of goethe in his youth so he does to me he is certainly as tall as goethe i didnt know tenors were ever so tall the mignon seems young too she was slender at any rate and very fragile beside the courtly wilhelm when she began her immortal song one felt that she was right for the part the pure lyric soprano that suits it best and in her voice there was something fresh and delicate like deep wood flowers connaistule pays it stirred one like the odours of early spring recalled the time of sweet impersonal emotions when the curtain fell on the first act st peter turned to his wife a fine cast dont you think and the harps are very good except for the woodwinds i should say it was as good as any performance i ever heard at the comique how it does make one think of paris and of so many halfforgotten things his wife murmured it had been long since he had seen her face so relaxed and reflective and undetermined through the next act he often glanced at her curious how a young mood could return and soften a face more than once he saw a starry moisture shine in her eyes if she only knew how much more lovely she was when she wasnt doing her duty my dear he sighed when the lights were turned on and they both looked older its been a mistake our having a family and writing histories and getting middleaged we should have been picturesquely shipwrecked together when we were young how often ive thought that she replied with a faint melancholy smile you but youre so occupied with the future you adapt yourself so readily he murmured in astonishment one must go on living godfrey but it wasnt the children who came between us there was something lonely and forgiving in her voice something that spoke of an old wound healed and hardened and hopeless you you too he breathed in amazement he took up one of her gloves and began drawing it out through his fingers she said nothing but he saw her lip quiver and she turned away and began looking at the house through the glasses he likewise began to examine the audience he wished he knew just how it seemed to her he had been mistaken he felt the heart of another is a dark forest always no matter how close it has been to ones own presently the melting music of the tenors last aria brought their eyes together in a smile not altogether sad that night after he was in bed among unaccustomed surroundings and a little wakeful st peter still played with his idea of a picturesque shipwreck and he cast about for the particular occasion he would have chosen for such a finale before he went to sleep he found the very day but his wife was not in it indeed nobody was in it but himself and a weatherdried little sea captain from the hautespyreacuteneacutees half a dozen spry seamen and a line of gleaming snow peaks agonizingly high and sharp along the southern coast of spain     louie arranged the birthday dinner in the public diningroom of the hotel and three of the professors colleagues dined with them on that occasion louie had gone out to the university to hear st peter lecture had met some of the faculty and immediately invited them to dinner they acceptedwhen was a professor known to refuse a good dinner rosamond was presented with her emeralds and as st peter afterward observed to his wife practically all the guests in the diningroom were participants in the happy event lillian was doubtless right when she told him that all the same his fellow professors went away from the blackstone that night respecting godfrey st peter more than they had ever done before and if they had marriageable daughters they were certainly envying him his luck that her husband replied is my chief objection to public magnificence it seems to show everybody up in the worst possible light im not finding fault with anyone but myself understand when i consented to occupy an apartment i couldnt afford i let myself in for whatever might follow they got back to hamilton in bitter weather the lake winds were scourging the town and scott had laryngitis and was writing prose poems about the pleasures of tending your own furnace when the thermometer is twenty below godfrey said mrs st peter when he set off for his classroom on the morning after their return surely youre not going to the old house this afternoon it will be like a refrigeratingplant theres no way of heating your study except by that miserable little stove there never was my dear i got along a good many years it was very different when the house below was heated that stove isnt safe when you keep the window open a gust of wind might blow it out at any moment and if you were at work youd never notice until you were half poisoned by gas youll get a fine headache one of these days ive got headaches that way before and survived them he said stubbornly how can you be so perverse you know things are different now and you ought to take more care of your health why so its not worth half so much as it was then his wife disregarded this and dont you think its foolish extravagance to go on paying the rent of an entire house in order to spend a few hours a day in one very uncomfortable room of it the professors dark skin reddened and the ends of his formidable eyebrows ascended toward his black hair its almost my only extravagance he muttered fiercely how irritable and unreasonable he is becoming his wife reflected as she heard him putting on his overshoes in the hall     chapter 9   for christmas day the weather turned mild again there would be a family dinner in the evening but st peter was going to have the whole day to himself in the old house he asked his wife to put him up some sandwiches so that he neednt come back for lunch he kept a few bottles of sherry in his study in the old chest under the forms fortunately he had brought back a great deal of it from his last trip to spain it wasnt foresightprohibition was then unthinkablebut a lucky accident he had gone with his innkeeper to an auction and bought in a dozen dozens of a sherry that went very cheap he came home by the city of mexico and got the wine through without duty as he was crossing the park with his sandwiches he met augusta coming back from mass are you still going to the old house professor she asked reproachfully her face smiling at him between her stiff black fur collar and her stiff black hat oh yes augusta but its not the same i miss you there are never any new dresses on my ladies in the evening now wont you come in sometime and deck them out as a surprise for me i like to see them looking smart augusta laughed you are a funny man doctor st peter if anyone else said the things you do to your classes id be scandalized but i always tell people you dont mean half you say and how do you know what i say to my classes may i ask why of course they go out and talk about it when you say slighting things about the church she said gravely but really augusta i dont think i ever do well they take it that way they are not as smart as you and you ought to be careful it doesnt matter what they think today theyll forget tomorrow he was walking beside augusta with a slack indifferent stride very unlike the step he had when he was full of something that reminds me ive been wanting to ask you a question that passage in the service about the mystical rose lily of zion tower of ivoryis that the magnificat augusta stopped and looked at him why professor did you receive no religious instruction at all how could i augusta my mother was a methodist there was no catholic church in our town in kansas and i guess my father forgot his religion that happens in mixed marriages augusta spoke meaningly ah yes i suppose so but tell me what is the magnificat then the magnificat begins my soul doth magnify the lord you must know that but i thought the magnificat was about the virgin oh no professor the blessed virgin composed the magnificat st peter became intensely interested oh she did augusta spoke gently as if she were prompting him and did not wish to rebuke his ignorance too sharply why yes just as soon as the angel had announced to her that she would be the mother of our lord the blessed virgin composed the magnificat i always think of you as knowing everything doctor st peter and youre always finding out how little i know well you dont give me away you are very discreet their ways parted and both went on more cheerful than when they met the professor climbed to his study feeling quite as though augusta had been there and brightened it up for him surely she had said that the blessed virgin sat down and composed the magnificat augusta had been with them often in the holiday season back in the years when holidays were holidays indeed he had grown to like the reminders of herself that she left in his workroomespecially the toilettes upon the figures sometimes she made those terrible women entirely plausible in the early years no matter how hard he was working he had always felt the sense of holiday of a special warmth and fragrance in the air steal up to his study from the house below when he was writing his best he was conscious of pretty little girls in fresh dressesof flowers and greens in the comfortable shabby sittingroomof his wifes good looks and good tasteeven of a better dinner than usual under preparation downstairs all the while he had been working so fiercely at his eight big volumes he was not insensible to the domestic drama that went on beneath him his mind had played delightedly with all those incidents just as when queen mathilde was doing the long tapestry now shown at bayeuxworking her chronicle of the deeds of knights and heroesalongside the big pattern of dramatic action she and her women carried the little playful pattern of birds and beasts that are a story in themselves so to him the most important chapters of his history were interwoven with personal memories on this christmas morning with that sense of the past in his mind the professor went mechanically to work and the morning disappeared before he knew it was passing the bells from augustas church across the park rang out and told him it was gone he pushed back his papers and arranged his writingtable for lunch he had been working hard he judged because he was so hungry he peered with interest into the basket his wife had given hima wicker bag it was really that he had once bought full of strawberries at gibraltar chicken sandwiches with lettuce leaves red california grapes and two shapely longnecked russet pears that would do very well and lillian had thoughtfully put in one of her best dinner napkins knowing he hated ugly linen from the chest he took out a round of cheese and a bottle of his wine and began to polish a sherry glass while he was enjoying his lunch he was thinking of certain holidays he had spent alone in paris when he was living at versailles with the thieraults as tutor to their boys there was one all souls day when he had gone into paris by an early train and had a magnificent breakfast on the rue de vaugirardnot at foyots he hadnt money enough in those days to put his nose inside the place after breakfast he went out to walk in the soft rainfall the sky was of such an intense silvery grey that all the grey stone buildings along the rue st jacques and the rue sufflot came out in that silver shine stronger than in sunlight the shop windows were shut on the bleak ascent to the pantheon there was not a spot of colour nothing but wet shiny quicksilvery grey accented by black crevices and weatherworn bosses white as woodash all at once from somewhere behind the pantheon itself a man and woman pushing a handcart came into the empty street the cart was full of pink dahlias all exactly the same colour the young man was fair and slight with a pale face the woman carried a baby both they and the heels of their barrow were splashed with mud they must have come from a good way in the country and were a weary anxiouslooking pair they stopped at a corner before the pantheon and fearfully scanned the bleak silvery deserted streets the man went into a bakery and his wife began to spread out the flowers which were done up in large bouquets with fresh green chestnutleaves young st peter approached and asked the price deux francs cinquante monsieur she said with a kind of desperate courage he took a bunch and handed her a fivefranc note she had no change her husband watching from the bakery came running across with a loaf of bread under his arm deux francs cinquante she called to him as he came up he put his hand into his pocket and fumbled deux francs cinquante she repeated with painful tension the price agreed upon had probably been a franc or a franc fifty the man counted out the change to the student and looked at his wife with admiration st peter was so pleased with his flowers that it hadnt occurred to him to get more but all his life he had regretted that he didnt buy two bunches and push their fortunes a little further he had never again found dahlias of such a beautiful colour or so charmingly arranged with bright chestnutleaves a moment later he was strolling down the hill wondering to whom he could give his bouquet when a pathetic procession filed past him through the rain the girls of a charity school came walking two and two in hideous dark uniforms and round felt hats without ribbon or bow marshalled by four blackbonneted nuns they were all looking down all but onethe pretty one naturallyand she was looking sidewise directly at the student and his flowers their eyes met she smiled and just as he put out his hand with the bouquet one of the sisters flapped up like a black crow and shut the girls pretty face from him she would have to pay for that smile he was afraid godfrey spent his day in the luxembourg gardens and walked back to the gare st lazare at evening with nothing but his return ticket in his pocket very glad to get home to versailles in time for the family dinner when he first went to live with the thieraults he had found madame thierault severe and exacting stingy about his laundry and grudging about the cheese and fruit he ate for dinner but in the end she was very kind to him she never pampered him but he could depend upon her her three sons had always been his dearest friends gaston the one he loved best was deadkilled in the boxer uprising in china but pierre still lived at versailles and charles had a business in marseilles when he was in france their homes were his they were much closer to him than his own brothers it was one summer when he was in france with lillian and the two little girls that the idea of writing a work upon the early spanish explorers first occurred to him and he had turned at once to the thieraults after giving his wife enough money to finish the summer and get home he took the little that was left and went down to marseilles to talk over his project with charles thierault fils whose mercantile house did a business with spain in cork clearly st peter would have to be in spain as much as possible for the next few years and he would have to live there very cheaply the thieraults were always glad of a chance to help him not with moneythey were too french and too logical for that but they would go to any amount of trouble and no inconsiderable expense to save him a few thousand francs that summer charles kept him for three weeks in his oleanderburied house in the prado until his little brig lespoir sailed out of the new port with a cargo for algeciras the captain was from the hautespyreacuteneacutees and his spare crew were all provenccedilals seamen trained in that hard school of the gulf of lyons on the voyage everything seemed to feed the plan of the work that was forming in st peters mind the skipper the old catalan second mate the sea itself one day stood out above the others all day long they were skirting the south coast of spain from the rose of dawn to the gold of sunset the ranges of the sierra nevadas towered on their right snow peak after snow peak high beyond the flight of fancy gleaming like crystal and topaz st peter lay looking up at them from a little boat riding low in the purple water and the design of his book unfolded in the air above him just as definitely as the mountain ranges themselves and the design was sound he had accepted it as inevitable had never meddled with it and it had seen him through     it was late on christmas afternoon when the professor got back to the new house but he was in such a happy frame of mind that he feared nothing not even a family dinner he quite looked forward to it on the contrary his wife heard him humming his favorite air from matrimonio segreto while he was dressing that evening the two daughters of the house arrived almost at the same moment when rosamond threw off her cloak in the hall her father noticed that she was wearing her new necklace kathleen stood looking at it and was evidently trying to find courage to say something about it when louie helped her by breaking in and kitty you havent seen our jewels what do you think just look at it i was looking its too lovely its very old you see the gold what a work i had finding it she doesnt like anything showy you know and she doesnt care about intrinsic values it must be beautiful first of all well it is that surely louie walked up and down admiring his wife she carries off things like that doesnt she and yet you know i like her in simple things too he dropped into reflection just as if her were alone and talking to himself i always remember a little bracelet she wore the night i first met her a turquoise set in silver wasnt it yes a turquoise set in dull silver have you it yet rosie i think so there was a shade of displeasure in rosamonds voice and she turned back into the hall to look for something where are the violets you brought for mamma mrs st peter came in followed by the maid and the cocktails scott began the usual prohibition lament why dont you journalists tell the truth about it in print louie asked him its a case where you could do something and lose my job not much this countrys split in two socially and i dont know if its ever coming together its not so hard on me i can drink hard liquor but you and the professor like wine and fancy stuff oh its nothing to us were going to france for the summer louie put his arm round his wife and rubbed his cheek against hers saying caressingly and drink burgundy burgundy burgundy please take me with you louie mrs st peter pleaded to distract him from his wife nothing made the mcgregors so uncomfortable and so wrathful as the tender moments which sometimes overtook the marselluses in public we are going to take you and papa too thats our plan i take him for safety if i travelled on the continent alone with two such handsome women it wouldnt be tolerated there would be a trumpedup quarrel and a stiletto and then somebody would be a widow turning again to his wife come here louie mrs st peter beckoned him i have a confession to make im afraid theres no dinner for you tonight no dinner for me no theres nothing either you or godfrey will like its scotts dinner tonight your tastes are so different i cant compromise and this is his from the cream soup to the frozen pudding but who said i didnt like cream soup and frozen pudding louie held out his hands to show their guiltlessness and are there haricots verts in the cream sauce i thought so and i like those too the truth is dearest he stood before her and tapped her chin with his finger the truth is that i like all scotts dinners its he who doesnt like mine hes the intolerant one true for you louie laughed the professor and its that way about lots of things said louie a little plaintively     kitty said scott as they were driving home that night kathleen in the drivers seat beside him that silver bracelet louie spoke of was one of toms trinkets wasnt it do you suppose she has some feeling for him still under all this pompuosity i dont know and i dont care but oh scott i do love you very much she cried vehemently he pinched off his drivingglove between his knees and snuggled his hand over hers inside her muff sure he muttered yes i do she said fiercely squeezing his knuckles together with all her might awful nice of you to have told me all about it at the start kitty most girls wouldnt have thought it necessary im the only one who knows aint i the only one who ever has known and im just the one another girl wouldnt have told why did you kit i dont know i suppose even then i must have had a feeling that you were the real one her head dropped on his shoulder you know you are the real one dont you i guess     chapter 10   that winter there was a meeting of an association of electrical engineers in hamilton louie marsellus who was a member gave a luncheon for the visiting engineers at the country club and then motored them to outland scott mcgregor was at the lunch with the other newspaper men on his return he stopped at the university and picked up his fatherinlaw ill run you over home which house the old how did you get out of louies party i had classes it was some lunch louies a good host firstrate cigars and plenty of them scott tapped his breast pocket we had poor tom served up again it was all right of coursethe scientific men were interested didnt know much about him louie called on me for personal recollections he was very polite about it i didnt express myself very well im not much of a speaker anyhow and this time i seemed to be talking uphill you know tom isnt very real to me any more sometimes i think he was just aa glittering idea here we are doctor scotts remark rather troubled the professor he went up the two flights of stairs and sat down in his shadowy crypt at the top of the house with his right elbow on the table his eyes on the floor he began recalling as clearly and definitely as he could every incident of that bright windy spring day when he first saw tom outland     he was working in his garden one saturday morning when a young man in a heavy winter suit and a stetson hat carrying a grey canvas telescope came in at the green door that led from the street are you professor st peter he inquired upon being assured he set down his bag on the gravel took out a blue cotton handkerchief and wiped his face which was covered with beads of moisture the first thing the professor noticed about the visitor was his manly mature voicelow calm experienced very different from the thin ring or the hoarse shouts of boyish voices about the campus the next thing he observed was the strong line of contrast below the young mans sandy hairthe very fair forehead which had been protected by his hat and the reddish brown of his face which had evidently been exposed to a stronger sun than the spring sun of hamilton the boy was finelooking he sawtall and presumably well built though the shoulders of his stiff heavy coat were so preposterously padded that the upper part of him seemed shut up in a case i want to go to school here professor st peter and ive come to ask you advice i dont know anybody in the town you want to enter the university i take it what high school are you from ive never been to high school sir thats the trouble why yes i hardly see how you can enter the university where are you from new mexico i havent been to school but ive studied i read latin with a priest down there st peter smiled incredulously how much latin i read caesar and virgil the aeligneid how many books we went right through he met the professors questions squarely his eyes were resolute like his voice oh you did st peter stood his spade against the wall he had been digging around his redfruited thorntrees can you repeat any of it the boy began infandum regina jubes renovare dolorem and steadily continued for fifty lines or more until st peter held up a checking hand excellent your priest was a thorough latinist you have a good pronunciation and good intonation was the father by any chance a frenchman yes sir he was a missionary priest from belgium did you learn any french from him no sir he wanted to practise his spanish you speak spanish not very well mexican spanish the professor tried him out in spanish and told him he thought he knew enough to get credit for a modern language and what are your deficiencies ive never had any mathematics or science and i write very bad hand thats not unusual st peter told him but by the way how did you happen to come to me instead of the registrar i just got in this morning and your name was the only one here i knew i read an article by you in a magazine about fray marcos father duchene said it was the only thing with any truth in it hed read about our country down there the professor had noticed before that whenever he wrote for popular periodicals it got him into trouble well what are your plans young man and by the way what is your name tom outland the professor repeated it it seemed to suit the boy exactly how old are you im twenty he blushed and st peter supposed he was dropping off a few years but he found afterward that the boy didnt know exactly how old he was i thought i might get a tutor and make up my mathematics this summer yes that could be managed how are you fixed for money outlands face grew grave im rather awkwardly fixed if you were to write to tarpin new mexico to inquire about me youd find i have money in the bank there and youd think i had been deceiving you but its money i cant touch while im ablebodied its in trust for someone else but ive got three hundred dollars without any string on it and im hoping to get work here ive been bossing a section gang all winter and im in good condition ill do anything but wait table i wont do that on this point he seemed to feel strongly the professor learned some of his story that morning his parents he said were mover people and both died when they were crossing southern kansas in a prairie schooner he was a baby and had been informally adopted by some kind people who took care of his mother in her last hoursa locomotive engineer named obrien and his wife this engineer was transferred to new mexico and took the foundling boy along with his own children as soon as tom was old enough to work he got a job as call boy and did his share toward supporting the family whats a call boy a messenger boy no sir its a more responsible position our town was an important freight division on the santa feacute and a lot of train men live there the freight schedule is always changing because its a single track road and the dispatcher has to get the freights through when he can suppose youre a brakeman and your train is due out at two am well like as not it will be changed to midnight or to four in the morning you go to bed as if you were going to sleep all night with nothing on your mind the call boy watches the schedule board and half an hour before your train goes out he comes and taps on your window and gets you up in time to make it the call boy has to be on to things in the town he must know when theres a poker game on and how to slip in easy you cant tell when theres a spotter about and if a mans reported for gambling hes fired sometimes you have to get a man when he isnt where he ought to be i found there was usually a reason at home for that the boy spoke with gravity as if he had reflected deeply upon irregular behaviour just then mrs st peter came out into the garden and asked her husband if he wouldnt bring his young friend in to lunch outland started and looked with panic toward the door by which he had come in but the professor wouldnt hear of his going and picked up his telescope to prevent his escape as he carried it into the house and put it down in the hall he noticed that it was strangely light for its bulk mrs st peter introduced the guest to her two little girls and asked him if he didnt want to go upstairs to wash his hands he disappeared as he came back something disconcerting happened the front hall and the front staircase were the only hard wood in the house but as tom came down the waxed steps his heavy new shoes shot out from under him and he sat down on the end of his spine with a thump little kathleen burst into a giggle and her elder sister looked at her reprovingly mrs st peter apologized for the stairs im not much used to stairs living mostly in dobe houses tom explained as he picked himself up at luncheon the boy was very silent at first he sat looking admiringly at mrs st peter and the little girls the day had grown warm and the professor thought this was the hottest boy he had ever seen his stiff white collar began to melt and his handkerchief as he kept wiping his face with it became a rag i didnt know it would be so warm up here or id have picked a lighter suit he said embarrassed by the activity of his skin we would like to hear more about your life in the southwest said his host how long were you a call boy two years then i had pneumonia and the doctor said i ought to go on the range so i went to work for a big cattle firm mrs st peter began to question him about the indian pueblos he was reticent at first but he presently warmed up in defence of indian housewifery he forgot his shyness so far indeed that having made a neat heap of mashed potato beside his chop he conveyed it to his mouth on the blade of his knife at which sight the little girls were not able to conceal their astonishment mrs st peter went on quietly talking about indian pottery and asking him where they made the best i think the very best is the oldthe cliffdweller pottery he said do you take an interest in pottery maam maybe youd like to see some i have brought along as they rose from the table he went to his telescope underneath the hatrack knelt beside it and undid the straps when he lifted the cover it seemed full of bulky objects wrapped in newspapers after feeling among them he unwrapped one and displayed an earthen water jar shaped like those common in greek sculpture and ornamented with a geometrical pattern in black and white thats one of the real old ones i know for i got it out myself i dont know just how old but theres pintildeon trees three hundred years old by their rings growing up in the stone trail that leads to the ruins where i got it stone trail pintildeons she asked yes deep narrow trails in white rock worn by their moccasin feet coming and going for generations and these old pintildeon trees have come up in the trails since the race died off you can tell something about how long ago it was by them he showed her a coating of black on the under side of the jar thats not from the firing see i can scratch it off its soot from when it was on the cookfire lastand that was before columbus landed i guess nothing makes those people seem so real to me as their old pots with the fireblack on them as she gave it back to him he shook his head that ones for you maam if you like it oh i couldnt think of letting you give it to me you must keep it for yourself or put it in a museum but that seemed to touch a sore spot museums he said bitterly they dont care about our things they want something that came from crete or egypt id break my jars sooner than they should get them but id like this one to have a good home among your nice thingshe looked about appreciatively ive no place to keep them theyre in my way especially that big one my trunk is at the station but i was afraid to leave the pottery you dont get them out whole like that very often but get them out of what from where i want to know all about it maybe some day maam i can tell you he said wiping his sooty fingers on his handkerchief his reply was courteous but final he strapped his bag and picked up his hat then hesitated and smiled taking a buckskin bag from his pocket he walked over to the windowseat where the children were and held out his hand to them saying these i would like to give to the little girls in his palm lay two lumps of soft blue stone the colour of robins eggs or of the sea on halcyon days of summer the children marvelled oh what are they turquoises just the way they come out of the mine before the jewellers have tampered with them and made them look green the indians like them this way again mrs st peter demurred she told him very kindly that she couldnt let him give his stones to the children they are worth a lot of money id never sell them they were given to me by a friend i have a lot and theyre no use to me but theyll make pretty playthings for little girls his voice was so wistful and winning that there was nothing to do hold them still a moment said the professor looking down not at the turquoises but at the hand that held them the muscular manylined palm the long strong fingers with soft ends the straight little finger the flexible beautifully shaped thumb that curved back from the rest of the hand as if it were its own master what a hand he could see it yet with the blue stones lying in it in a moment the stranger was gone and the st peter family sat down and looked at one another he remembered just what his wife had said on that occasion well this is something new in students godfrey we ask a poor perspiring tramp boy to lunch to save his pennies and he departs leaving princely gifts yes the professor reflected after all these years that was still true fellows like outland dont carry much luggage yet one of the things you know them by is their sumptuous generosityand when they are gone all you can say of them is that they departed leaving princely gifts with a good tutor young outland had no difficulty in making up three years mathematics in four months latin he owned had been hard for him but in mathematics he didnt have to work he had merely to give his attention his tutor had never known anything like it but st peter held the boy at arms length as a young teacher full of zeal he had been fooled more than once he knew that the wonderful seldom holds water that brilliancy has no staying power and the unusual becomes commonplace by a natural law in those first months mrs st peter saw more of their proteacutegeacute than her husband did she found him a good boardingplace took care that he had proper summer clothes and that he no longer addressed her as maam he came often to the house that summer to play with the little girls he would spend hours with them in the garden making hopi villages with sand and pebbles drawing maps of the painted desert and the rio grande country in the gravel telling them stories when there was no one by to listen about the adventures he had had with his friend roddy mother kathleen broke out one evening at dinner what do you think tom hasnt any birthday how is that when his mother died in the mover wagon and tom was a baby she forgot to tell the obriens when his birthday was she even forgot to tell them how old he was they thought he must be a year and a half because he was so big but mrs obrien always said he didnt have enough teeth for that st peter asked her whether tom had ever said how it happened that his mother died in a wagon well you see she was very sick and they were going west for her health and one day when they were camped beside a river toms father went in to swim and had a cramp or something and was drowned toms mother saw it and it made her worse she was there all alone till some people found her and drove her on to the next town to a doctor but when they got her there she was too sick to leave the wagon they drove her into the obriens yard because that was nearest the doctors and mrs obrien was a kind woman and she died in a few hours does tom know anything about his father nothing except that he was a schoolteacher in missouri his mother told the obriens that much but the obriens were just lovely to him st peter had noticed that in the stories tom told the children there were no shadows kathleen and rosamond regarded his freelance childhood as a gay adventure they would gladly have shared they loved to play at being tom and roddy roddy was the remarkable friend ten years older than tom who knew everything about snakes and panthers and deserts and indians and he gave up a fine job firing on the santa feacute and went off with tom to ride after cattle for hardly any wages just to be with tom and take care of him after hed had pneumonia kathleen told them that wasnt the only reason rosamond added dreamily roddy was proud he didnt like taking orders and living on pay cheques he liked to be free and to sit in his saddle all day and use it for a pillow at night you know tom said that kitty anyhow he was noble he was always noble noble roddy kathleen finished it off after the first day when he had walked into the garden and introduced himself tom never took up the story of his own life again either with the professor or mrs st peter though he was often encouraged to do so he would talk about the new mexico country when questioned about father duchene the missionary priest who had been his teacher about the indians but only with the two little girls did he ever speak freely and confidentially about himself st peter used to wonder how the boy could afford to spend so much time with the children all through that summer and fall he used to come in the afternoon and join them in the garden in the winter he dropped in two or three evenings a week to play five hundred or to take a dancinglesson there was evidently something enchanting about the atmosphere of the house to a boy who had always lived a rough life he enjoyed the prettiness and freshness and gaiety of the little girls as if they were flowers probably too he liked being so attractive to them a flush of pleasure would come over toms faceso much fairer now than when he first arrived in hamiltonif kathleen caught his hand and tried to squeeze it hard enough to hurt crying oh tom tell us about the time you and roddy found the water hole dry and then afterward tell us about when the rattlesnake bit henry he would whisper pretty soon and after a while through the open windows the professor would hear them in the garden the laughter and exclamations of the little girls and that singularly individual voice of tomsmature confident seldom varying in pitch but full of slight very moving modulations he couldnt have wished for a better companion for his daughters and they were teaching tom things that he needed more than mathematics     sitting thus in his study long afterward st peter reflected that those first years before outland had done anything remarkable were really the best of all he liked to remember the charming groups of three he was always coming uponin the hammock swung between the lindentrees in the windowseat or before the diningroom fire oh there had been fine times in this old house then family festivals and hospitalities little girls dancing in and out augusta coming and going gay dresses hanging in his study at night christmas shopping and secrets and smothered laughter on the stairs when a man had lovely children in his house fragrant and happy full of pretty fancies and generous impulses why couldnt he keep them was there no way but medeas he wondered     chapter 11   st peter had come in late from an afternoon lecture and had just lighted his kerosene lamp to go to work when he heard a light foot ascending the stairs in a moment kathleens voice called may i interrupt for a moment papa he opened the door and drew her in kitty do you remember the time you sat out there with your beesting and your bottle nobody ever showed me more consideration than that not even your mother kathleen threw her hat and jacket into the sewingchair and walked about touching things to see how dusty they were ive been wondering if you didnt need me to come in and clean house for you but its not so bad as they report it this is the first time ive called on you since youve been here alone ive turned in from the walk more than once but ive always run away again she paused to warm her hands at the little stove im silly you know such queer things make me blue and you still have augustas old forms i dont think anything ever happened to her that amused her so much and now you know shes quite sentimental about their being here its about augusta that i came papa did you know that she had lost some of her savings in the kinkoo copper company augusta are you sure what a shame yes she was sewing for me last week i noticed that she seemed depressed and hadnt much appetite for lunchwhich you know is unusual for augusta she was ashamed to tell any of us about it because it seems shed asked louies advice and he told her not to invest in that company but a lot of the people in her church were putting money into it and of course that made it seem all right to her she lost five hundred dollars a fortune for her and scott says shell never get a cent of it back five hundred dollars murmured st peter let me see at three dollars a day that means one hundred and sixtysix days now what can we do about it of course we must do something i knew youd feel that way father certainly among us we must cover it ill speak to rosamond tonight you neednt dear kathleen tossed her head i have been to her she refuses refuses she cant refuse my dear ill have a word to say the firmness of his tone and the quick rush of claret colour under his skin were a gratification to his daughter she says that louie took the trouble to speak to his banker and to several copper men before he advised augusta and that if she doesnt learn her lesson this time she will do the same thing over again rosamond said they would do something for augusta later but she didnt say what leave rosamond to me ill convince her even if you can do anything with her shes determined to make augusta admit her folly and it cant be done that way augusta is terribly proud when i told her her customers ought to make it up to her she was very haughty and said she wasnt that kind of a sewingwoman that she gave her ladies good measure for their money scott thought we could buy stock in some good company and tell her we had used our influence and got an exchange but that she must keep quiet about it we could manage some such little fib she knows so little about business i know i can get the dudleys and the browns to help we neednt go to the marselluses wait a few days its a disgrace to us as a family not to make it up ourselves on her own account we oughtnt to let rosamond out shes altogether too blind to responsibilities of that kind in a world full of blunders why should augusta have to pay scrupulously for her mistakes its very petty of rosie really kathleen started to speak stopped and turned away scott will give a hundred dollars she said a moment later thats very generous of him ill give another and rosie shall make up the rest if she doesnt ill speak to louie hes an absolutely generous chap ive never known him to refuse to give either time or money kathleens eyes suddenly brightened why daddy you have toms mexican blanket i never knew he gave it to you ive often wondered what became of it she picked up from the foot of the boxcouch a purple blanket faded in streaks to amethyst with a pale yellow stripe at either end oh yes i often get chilly when i lie down especially if i turn the stove out which your mother says i ought always to do nothing could part me from that blanket he wouldnt have given it to anybody but you it was like his skin do you remember how horsey it smelled when he first brought it over and showed it to us just like a livery stable it had been strapped behind the saddle on so many sweating cowponies in damp weather that smell is still perceptible kathleen stroked it thoughtfully roddy brought it up from old mexico you know he gave it to tom that winter he had pneumonia tom ought to have taken it to france with him he used to say that rodney blake might turn up in the foreign legion if he had taken this it might have been like the wooden cups that were always revealing amis and amile to each other st peter smiled and patted her hand on the blanket do you know kitty i sometimes think i ought to go out and look for blake myself hes on my conscience if that country down there werent so everlastingly big oh father that was my romantic dream when i was little finding roddy i used to think about it for hours when i was supposed to be taking my nap i used to swim rivers and climb mountains and wander about with navajos and rescue roddy at the most critical moments when he was being stabbed in the back or drugged in a gamblinghouse and bring him back to tom you know tom told us about him long before he ever told you you children used to live in his stories you cared more about them than about all your adventure books i still do said kathleen rising now that rosamond has outland i consider toms mesa entirely my own st peter put down the cigarette he had just lighted with anticipation cant you stay awhile kitty i almost never see anyone who remembers that side of tom it was nice all those years when he was in and out of the house like an older brother always very different from the other college boys wasnt he always had something in his voice in his eyes one seemed to catch glimpses of an unusual background behind his shoulders when he came into the room kathleen smiled wanly yes and now hes all turned out chemicals and dollars and cents hasnt he but not for you and me our tom is much nicer than theirs she put on her jacket and went out of the study and quickly down the stairs her father on the landing looked after until she disappeared when she was gone he still stood there motionless as if he were listening intently or trying to fasten upon some fugitive idea     chapter 12   st peter was breakfasting at sixthirty alone reading last nights letters while he waited for the coffee to percolate it had been long since he had had an eight oclock class but this year the schedule committee had slyly put him down for one he can afford to take a taxi over now the dean remarked after breakfast he went upstairs and into his wifes room i have a rendezvous with a lady he said tossing an envelope upon her counterpane she read a note from mrs crane the least attractive of the faculty ladies requesting an interview with the professor at his earliest convenience as she wished to see him quite alone might she come to his study in the old house where she understood he still worked poor godfrey murmured his wife one ought not to joke about it st peter went into his room to get a handkerchief and came back taking up his suspended sentence im afraid it means poor crane is coming up for another operation or worse still that the surgeons tell her another would be useless its like the pit and the pendulum i feel as if the poor fellow were strapped down on a revolving disk that comes around under the knife just so often mrs st peter looked judicially at the letter then at her husbands back she didnt believe that surgery would be the subject of discussion when they met mrs crane had been behaving very strangely of late doctor crane had married a girl whom no other man ever thought of courting a girl of whom people always said oh shes so good chiefly because she was so homely they had three very plain daughters and only cranes salary to live upon doctors and surgeons kept them poor enough st peter kissed his wife and went forth quite unconscious of what was going on in her mind during the morning he telephoned mrs crane and arranged a meeting with her at five oclock as the bell in the old house didnt work now he waited downstairs on the front porch to receive his visitor and conduct her up to his study it was raining drearily and mrs crane arrived in a rubber coat and a knitted sport hat belonging to one of her daughters st peter took her wet umbrella and led her up the two flights of stairs im not very well appointed to receive ladies mrs crane this was the sewingroom you know theres augustas chair which she insisted was comfortable thank you mrs crane sat down took off her gloves and tucked wisps of damp hair up under her crocheted hat her bleak plain face wore an expression of grievance ive come without my husbands knowledge doctor st peter to ask you what you think can be done about our rights in the outland patent you know how my husbands health has crippled us financially and we never know when his trouble may come on worse again myself ive never doubted that you would see it is only right to share with us st peter looked at her in amazement but my dear mrs crane how can i share with you what i havent got tom willed his estate and royalties in a perfectly regular way the fact that he named my daughter as his sole beneficiary doesnt affect me any more than if he had named some relative of his own i tell you frankly i have never received one dollar from the outland patent its all the same if it goes to your family doctor st peter my husband must be considered in this matter he spent days and nights working with outland tom never could have worked his theory out without roberts help he said so more than once in my presence and in the presence of others oh i believe that mrs crane but the difficulty is that tom didnt make any recognition of that assistance in his will mrs crane had set her head and advanced her long chin with meek determination well this is how it was professor mr marsellus came here a stranger to put in the edison power plant just at the time the city was stirred up about outlands being killed at the front everybody was wanting to do something in recognition of the young man you brought mr marsellus to our house and introduced him after that he came alone again and again and he got round my husband robert thought he was disinterested and was only taking a scientific interest and he told him a great deal about what he and outland had been working on then rosamonds lawyers came for the papers tom outland had no laboratory of his own he was allowed the use of a room in the physics building at my husbands request he wanted to be there because he constantly needed roberts help the first thing we knew your daughters engagement to marsellus was announced and then we heard that all outlands papers had been given over to him here st peter anticipated her but mrs crane your husband couldnt and wouldnt have kept toms papers they had to be given over to his executor who was my daughters attorney well i could have kept them if he couldntmrs crane threw up her head as if to show that the worm had turned at lastkept them until justice was done us and some recognition had been made of my husbands part in all that research work if he had taken the papers to court then with all the evidence we have we could easily have got an equity but mr marsellus is very smooth he flattered robert and got everything there was but he didnt get anything from your husband outlands papers and apparatus were delivered to his executor as was inevitable that was poor subterfuge said mrs crane with deep meaning you know how unworldly robert is and as an old friend you might have warned us of what mrs crane why that marsellus saw there was a fortune in the gas my husband and his pupil had made and we could have asked for our equity before we gave your soninlaw a free hand with everything st peter felt very unhappy he began walking up and down the little room heaven knows id like to see crane get something out of it but how how ive thought a great deal about this matter and ive blamed tom for making that kind of will i dont think it occurred to the boy that the will would ever be probated he expected to come back from the war and develop the thing himself i doubt whether robert with all his superior knowledge would have known the twists and turns by which the patent could be commercialized it took a great deal of work and a special kind of ability to do that a salesmans ability mrs crane was becoming nasty if you like but certainly robert would have been no man to convince manufacturers and machinists any more than i would a great deal of money was put into it too before any came back every cent marsellus had and all he could borrow he took heavy chances crane and i together could never have raised a hundredth part of the capital that was necessary to get the thing started without capital to make it go toms idea was merely a formula written out on paper it had lain for two years in your husbands laboratory and would have lain there for years more before he or i would have done anything about it mrs cranes dreary face took on more animation than he had supposed it capable of it had lain there because it belonged there and was made there my husband was done out of it by an adventurer and his friendship for you tied his hands i must say youve shown very little consideration for him you might have warned us never to let those papers go you see robert getting weaker all the time and having those terrible operations and our girls going shabby and teaching in the ward schools and rosamond riding about in a limousine and building country housesand you do nothing about it you take your honoursyouve deserved them we never forget thatand move into your new house and you dont remember what it is to be in straitened circumstances st peter drew his chair nearer to mrs crane and addressed her patiently mrs crane if you had any legal rights in the patent id defend them against rosamond as soon as against anyone else i think she ought to recognize dr cranes long friendship and helpfulness to tom in some way i dont see just how it can be done but i feel it should be and if you wish ill tell rosamond how i feel why dont you put this matter before her i dont care to ask anything of mrs marsellus i wrote her some time ago and she replied to me through her lawyer saying that all claims against the outland patent would be considered in due order its not worthy of a man in roberts position to accept hush money from the marselluses we want justice and my brother is confident the court will give it to us well i suppose bright knows more about what the courts will do than i but if youve decided to go to law about it why did you come to me there are some things the law dont cover said mrs crane mysteriously as she rose and put on her gloves i wanted you to know how we feel about it st peter followed her downstairs and put up her umbrella for her and then went back to his study to think it over his friendship with crane had been a strange one out in the world they would almost certainly have kept clear of each other but in the university they fought together in a common cause both with all their might had resisted the new commercialism the aim to show results that was undermining and vulgarizing education the state legislature and the board of regents seemed determined to make a trade school of the university candidates for the degree of bachelor of arts were allowed credits for commercial studies courses in bookkeeping experimental farming domestic science dressmaking and what not every year the regents tried to diminish the number of credits required in science and the humanities the liberal appropriations the promotions and increases in salary all went to the professors who worked with the regents to abolish the purely cultural studies out of a faculty of sixty there were perhaps twenty men who made any serious stand for scholarship and robert crane was one of the staunchest he had lost the deanship of the college of science because of his uncompromising opposition to the degrading influence of politicians in university affairs the honour went instead to a much younger man head of the department of chemistry who was willing to give the taxpayers what they wanted the struggle to preserve the dignity of the university and their own had brought st peter and dr crane much together they were moreover the only two men on the faculty who were doing research work of an uncommercial nature and they occasionally dropped in on one another to exchange ideas but that was as far as it went st peter couldnt ask crane to dinner the presence of a bottle of claret on the table would have made him uncomfortable dr crane had all the prejudices of the baptist community in which he grew up he carried them with him when he went to study at a german university and brought them back but crane knew that none of his colleagues followed his work so closely and rejoiced at his little triumphs so heartily as st peter st peter couldnt help admiring the mans courage poor ill overworked held by his conscience to a generous discharge of his duties as a teacher he was all the while carrying on these tedious and delicate experiments that had to do with determining the extent of space fortunately crane seemed to have no social needs or impulses he never went anywhere except once or twice a year to a dinner at the presidents house music disturbed him too much dancing shocked himhe couldnt see why it was permitted among the students once after mrs st peter had set next to him at the presidents dinnertable she said to her husband the man is too dreary all evening his heavy underwear kept coming down below his cuffs and he kept poking it back with his forefinger i believe he thinks its wicked to live with even so plain a woman as mrs crane after tom outland graduated from the university he and dr crane worked side by side in the physics building for several years the older man had been of great assistance to the younger without doubt though that kind of help the result of criticism and suggestion is not easily reckoned in percentages still st peter thought crane ought to get something out of the patent he resolved to see louie about it but first he had better talk with crane himself and try to dissuade him from going to law his brotherinlaw homer bright would be tempted by the publicity which an action involving the outland patent would certainly bring him but he would lose the case and crane would get nothing whereas louie if he were properly approached would be generous st peter looked at his watch he would go home now and after dinner he would walk over to the physics building where his colleague worked every night he never went to see crane at his house if he could help it he lived in the most depressing and unnecessary ugliness     chapter 13   at dinner lillian asked him no questions about his interview with mrs crane and he volunteered no information she was not surprised however when he said he would not stop for a cigar as he was going over to the physics laboratory he walked through the park past the old house and across the north end of the campus to a building that stood off by itself in a grove of pinetrees it was constructed of red brick after an english model the architect had had a good idea and he very nearly succeeded in making a good thing something like the old smithsonian building in washington but after it was begun the state legislature had defeated him by grinding down the contractor to cheap execution and had spoiled everything outside and in ever since it was finished plumbers and masons and carpenters had been kept busy patching and repairing it crane and st peter both young men then had wasted weeks of time with the contractors and had finally gone before the legislative committee in person to plead for the integrity of that building but nothing came of all their pains it was one of many lost causes st peter entered the building and went upstairs to a small room at the end of a chain of laboratories after knocking he heard the familiar shuffle of cranes carpet slippers and the door opened crane was wearing a grey cotton coat shrunk to a rag by washing though he wasnt working with fluids or batteries tonight but at a rolltop desk littered with papers the room was like any study behind a lecture room dusty books dusty files but no apparatusexcept a spiritlamp and a little saucepan in which the physicist heated water for his cocoa at regular intervals he was working by the glare of an unshaded electric bulb of high powerthe man seemed to have no feeling for comfort of any kind he asked his visitor to sit down and to excuse him for a moment while he copied some entries into a notebook st peter watched him scribbling with his fountain pen the hands that were so deft in delicate manipulations were white and softlooking the fingers long and loosely hung stained with chemicals and blunted at the tips like a violinists his head was square and the lower part of his face was covered by a reddish matted beard his pale eyes and fawncoloured eyebrows were outbalanced by his mouth his most conspicuous feature one always remembered about crane that unexpected startling red mouth in a setting of kinky beard the lips had no modelling they were as thick at the corners as in the middle and he spoke through them rather than with them he seemed painfully conscious of them st peter saw no use in beating about the bush as soon as crane put down his pen he remarked that mrs crane had been to see him that afternoon his colleague flushed took up a large celluloid paperknife and began shutting and unshutting his hands about the blade i want to know exactly how you feel about this and what the facts are st peter began weve never discussed it before and there may be things i know nothing about did tom ever say that he meant you to have a share in his profits if there were any no not exactly not exactly that dr crane moved his shoulders about in his tight coat and looked embarrassed and unhappy more than once he said in a general way that he hoped it would go on my account as well as on his own and that we would use the income for further experiments did he talk much about the possible commercial value of the gas while he was trying to make it not much no very seldom perhaps not more than half a dozen times in the three years he was working in my laboratory but whenever he did he spoke as if there would be something in it for both of us if our gas became remunerative just how much was it our gas crane strictly speaking of course it wasnt the idea was outlands he benefited by my criticism and i often helped him with his experiments he never acquired a nice laboratory technic he would fail repeatedly in some perfectly sound experiment because of careless procedure do you think he would have arrived at his results without your help dr crane was clenching the paperknife with both hands that i cannot say he was impatient he might have got discouraged and turned to something else he would have been much slower in getting his results at any rate his conception was right but very delicate manipulation was necessary and he was a careless experimentor st peter felt that this was becoming nothing less than crossexamination he tried to change the tone of it i want to see you get recognition and compensation for whatever part you had in his experiments if theres any way to get it but youve been neglectful crane you havent taken the proper steps why in the world didnt you have some understanding with tom when he was getting his patent you knew all about it it didnt occur to me then wed finished the experiments and i put them out of my mind i was trying to concentrate on my own work his results werent as interesting scientifically as id expected them to be while his manuscripts and formulaelig were lying here those two years did you ever make the gas or give any study to its behaviour no of course not its off my own line and didnt interest me then its only since this patent has begun to make money that it does interest you dr crane twisted his shoulders yes its the money heaven knows id like to see you get some of it but why did you put it off so long why didnt you make some claim when you delivered the papers to his executor since you hadnt done so before why didnt you bring the matter up to me then and let me make a claim against the estate for you dr crane could endure his chair no longer he began to walk softly about in his slippers looking at nothing but as he talked picking up objects here and theredrawingtools his cocoacup a china creampitcher turning them round and carefully putting them down again just as he often absently handled pieces of apparatus when he was lecturing i know he said appearances are against me but you must understand my negligence you know how little opportunity a man has to carry on his own line of investigation here you know how much time i give to any of my students who are doing honest work outland was of course the most brilliant pupil i ever had and i gave him time and thought without stint gladly of course if he were reaping the rewards of his discovery himself id have nothing to saythough ive not the least doubt he would compensate me liberally but it does not seem right that a stranger should profit and not those who helped him you of course do profitindirectly if not directly you cannot shut your eyes to the fact that this money coming into your family has strengthened your credit and your general security thats as it should be but your claim was less definite than mine i spent time and strength i could ill afford to spare on the very series of experiments that led to this result marsellus gets the benefit of my work as well as outlands i have certainly been illusedand as you say its difficult to get recompense when i ask for it so late its not to my discredit certainly that i didnt take measures to protect my interests i never thought of my students work in terms of money there were others who did and i was not considered he concluded bitterly why dont you put in a claim to marsellus for your time and expert advice i think hed honour it he is going to live here he probably doesnt wish to be more unpopular than a suddenly prosperous man is bound to be and you have many friends i believe i can convince him that it would be poor policy to disregard any reasonable demand i had thought of that but my wifes brother advises a different course ah yes mrs crane said something of that sort well crane if youre going to law about it i hope youll consult a sound lawyer and you know as well as i that homer bright is not one dr crane coloured and bridled im sure you are disinterested st peter but frankly i think your judgment has been warped by events you dont realize how clear the matter is to unprejudiced minds though im such an unpractical man i have evidence to rest my claims upon the more the better if you are going to depend on such a windbag as bright if you go to law id like to see you win your case st peter said goodnight went down the stairs and out through the dark pinetrees evidence crane said probably letters tom had written him during the winter he was working at johns hopkins well there was nothing to be done unless he could get old dr hutchins to persuade crane to employ an intelligent lawyer homer brights rhetoric might influence a jury in a rape or bigamy case but it would antagonize a judge in an equity court the professor took a turn in the park before going home the interview had depressed him and he was afraid he might be wakeful he had never seen his colleague in such an unbecoming light before crane was narrow but he was straight a man you could count on in the shifty game of college politics he had never been out to get anything for himself st peter would have said that nothing about the vulgar success of outlands idea could possibly matter to crane beyond gratifying his pride as a teacher and friend the park was deserted the arclights were turned off the leafless trees stood quite motionless in the light of the clear stars the world was sad to st peter as he looked about him the lakeshore country flat and heavy hamilton small and tight and airless the university his new house his old house everything around him seemed insupportable as the boat on which he is imprisoned seems to a seasick man yes it was possible that the little world on its voyage among all the stars might become like that a boat on which one could travel no longer from which one could no longer look up and confront those bright rings or revolution he brought himself back with a jerk ah yes crane that was the trouble if outland were here tonight he might say with mark antony my fortunes have corrupted honest men     chapter 14   at the end of the semester st peter went to chicago with rosamond to help her buy things for her country house he had very much wanted to stay at home and restthe university work seemed to take it out of him that winter more than ever before but rosamond had set her mind on his going and mrs st peter told him he couldnt refuse a chicago merchant had brought over a lot of old spanish furniture and on this nobodys judgement would be better than st peters he was supposed to know a good deal about rugs too when his wife said a thing must be done the professor usually did it from longestablished habit her instincts about what one owed to other people were better than his louie accompanied them to chicago where he was to join his brother the one who was in the silk trade in china and go on to new york with him for a family reunion st peter was amused and pleased to see that louie sincerely hated to leave themwith very little encouragement he would have sent his brother on alone and remained in chicago with his wife and fatherinlaw they all lunched together after which the professor and rosamond took the marsellus brothers to the lasalle street station when louie had again and again kissed his hand to them from the rear platform of the twentieth century observation car and was rolled away in the very act of shouting something to his wife st peter who had so often complained that there was to much louie in his life now felt a sudden drop a distinct sense of loss he took rosamonds arm and they turned away from the shining rails we must be diligent rosie he expects wonders of us     scott mcgregor got on the blue bird express one afternoon returning from a business trip for his paper on entering the smokingcar he came upon his fatherinlaw lying back in a leather chair his clothes covered with dust his eyes closed a dead cigar hanging between the relaxed fingers of his dark muscular hand it gave scott a start he thought the professor didnt look well hello doctor what are you doing here oh yes the shopping expedition wheres rosamond in chicago at the blackstone outlasted you did she thats it the professor smiled apologetically as if he were ashamed to admit it scott sat down beside him and tried to interest him in one subject after another without success it occurred to him that he had never before seen the professor when he seemed absolutely flattened out and listless that was a bad sign he was glad they were only half an hour from hamilton the old chap needs rest he reflected rosamonds run him to death in chicago he oughtnt to be used as a courier anyhow im going to tell kitty that we must look out for her father a little the marselluses have no mercy and lillian has always taken it for granted that he was as strong as three men     that evening mrs st peter was standing by the french windows in the drawingroom watching somewhat anxiously for her husband the chicago train was usually punctual and surely he would have taken a cab from the station for it was a raw february night with a freezing wind blowing off the lake st peter arrived on foot however as he came through the gate she could see by his walk and the set of his shoulders that he was very tired she hurried to open the front door and asked him why he hadnt come up in a taxi didnt think of it really im a creature of habit and thats one of the things i never used to do and in you lightest overcoat i thought you only wore this one because you were going to buy a new fur coat in chicago well i didnt he said rather shortly lets omit the verb to buy in all forms for a time keep dinner back a little will you lillian i want to take a warm bath and dress i did get rather chilled coming up mrs st peter went to the kitchen and after a discreet interval followed her husband upstairs and into his room i know youre tired but tell me one thing did you find the painted spanish bedroom set oh dear yes several of them and were they pretty very at least i think id have found them so if id come upon them without so many other things too much is certainly worse than too littleof anything it turned out to be rather an orgy of acquisition rosamond lost her head oh no perfectly cool i should say she had a faultless purchasing manner wonder where a girl who grew up in that old house of ours ever got it she was like napoleon looting the italian palaces dont be harsh you had a nice little vacation at any rate a very expensive one for a poor professor and not much rest a look of sharp anxiety came into mrs st peters face you mean she breathed in a hushed voice that she let you he cut in sharply i mean that i paid my way as i hope always to be able to do any suggestion to the contrary might have been very graceful but it would have been rejected i am quite ready to permit myself a little extravagance to be of service to the women of my family any other arrangement is humiliating then that was why you didnt get your fur coat that may have been one reason i was not much in the humour for it mrs st peter went swiftly downstairs to make him a cocktail she sensed an unusual weariness in him and felt as it were the bitter taste on his tongue a man she knew could get from his daughter a peculiar kind of hurtone of the cruellest that flesh is heir to her heart ached for godfrey when the professor had been warmed and comforted by a good dinner he lit a cigar and sat down before the hearth to read after a while his wife saw that the book had slid to his knee and he was looking into the fire studying his dark profile she noticed that the corners of his funny eyebrows rose as if he were amused by something what are you thinking about godfrey she said presently just then you were smilingquite agreeably i was thinking he answered absently about euripides how when he was an old man he went and lived in a cave by the sea and it was thought queer at the time it seems that houses had become insupportable to him i wonder whether it was because he had observed women so closely all his life     chapter 15   the month of march was the dreariest and bleakest of the year in hamilton and louie strove to brighten it by opening a discussion of plans for the summer he had been hinting for some time that he had a very attractive project up his sleeve and though he had not succeeded in keeping it from mrs st peter he said nothing to the professor until one night when they were dining at the marselluses all through dinner louie kept reminding them of the specialties of this and that paris restaurant so that st peter was not altogether unprepared as they left the diningroom louie burst out with it he and rosamond were to take doctor and mrs st peter to france for the summer louie had decided upon the dates the boat the itinerary he was intoxicated with the pleasure of planning understand he said it is to be our excursion from hamilton back to hamilton well travel in the most ample comfort but not in magnificence well go down to biarritz for a little fashionable life and stop at marseilles to see your fosterbrother charles thierault the rest of the summer well lead a scholarly life in paris i have my own reasons for wishing you to go along professor the pleasure of your company would be quite enough but i have also other reasons i want to see the intellectual side of paris and to meet some of the savants and men of letters whom you know what a shame gaston paris is not living we could very nicely make up a little party at lapeacuterouse for him but there are others mrs st peter developed the argument yes louie you and godfrey can lunch with the scholars while rosamond and i are shopping marsellus looked alarmed not at all dearest its to be understood that i always shop with you i adore the shops in paris besides we shall want you with us when we lunch with celebrities when was a savant and a frenchman not eager for the company of two charming ladies at deacutejeuner and you may have too much of the society of your sposi very nice for you to have variety you must keep a little engagement book lundi deacutejeuner m emile faguet mercredi diner m anatole france and so on st peter chuckled im afraid you exaggerate the circumference of my social circle louie i havent the pleasure of knowing anatole france no matter we can have m paul bourget for wednesday you can help us too about finding things for the house papa said rosamond we expect to pick up a good many things the thieraults ought to know good shops down in the south where prices have not gone up im afraid the antiquaries are centralized in paris i never saw anything very interesting in lyons or the midi however they may exist charles thierault is still interested in a shippingline that runs to the city of mexico for us they would go in without duty and louie thinks he can get them across the border as household goods that sounds practicable rosie it might be managed marsellus laughed and patted his wifes hand ohho cher papa you havent begun to find how practical we can be well louie its a tempting idea and ill think it over ill see whether i can arrange my work st peter knew at that moment that he would never be one of this lighthearted expedition and he hated himself for the ungracious drawingback that he felt in the region of his diaphragm the family discussed their summer plans all evening louie wanted to write at once for rooms at the meurice but mrs st peter ruled it out as too expensive that night after he was in bed st peter tried in vain to justify himself in his inevitable refusal he liked paris and he liked louie but one couldnt do ones own things in another persons way selfish or not that was the truth besides he would not be needed he could trust louie to take every care of lillian and nobody could please her more than her soninlaw beauxfils apparently were meant by providence to take the husbands place when husbands had ceased to be lovers marsellus never forgot one of the hundred foolish little attentions that lillian loved best of all he admired her extravagantly her distinction was priceless to him many people admired her but louie more than most that worldliness that willingness to get the most out of occasions and people which had developed so strongly in lillian in the last few years seemed to louie as natural and proper as it seemed unnatural to godfrey it was an element that had always been in lillian and as long as it resulted in mere fastidiousness was not a means to an end st peter liked it too he knew it was due to this worldliness even more than to the fact that his wife had a little money of her own that she and his daughters had never been drab and a little pathetic like some of the faculty women they hadnt much but they were never absurd they never made shabby compromises if they couldnt get the right thing they went without usually they had the right thing and it got paid for somehow he couldnt say they were extravagant the old house had been funny and bare enough but there were no ugly things in it since rosamonds marriage to marsellus both she and her mother had changed bewilderingly in some respectschanged and hardened but louie who had done the damage had not damaged himself it was to him that one appealedfor augusta for professor crane for the bruised feelings of people less fortunate it was less because of louie than for any other reason that he would refuse this princely invitation he could get out of it without hurting anybodythough he knew louie would be sorry he could simply insist that he must work and that he couldnt work away from his old study there were some advantages about being a writer of histories the desk was a shelter one could hide behind it was a hole one could creep into     when st peter told his family of his decision louie was disappointed but he was respectful and readily conceded that the professors first duty was to his work rosamond was incredulous and piqued she didnt see how he could be so ungenerous as to spoil an arrangement which would give pleasure to everyone concerned his wife looked at him with thoughtful disbelief when they were alone together she approached the matter more directly than was her wont nowadays godfrey she said slowly and sadly i wonder what it is that makes you draw away from your family or who it is my dear are you going to be jealous i wish i were going to be id much rather see you foolish about some woman than becoming lonely and inhuman well the habit of living with ideas grows on one i suppose just as inevitably as the more cheerful habit of living with various ladies theres something to be said for both i think your ideas were best when you were your most human self st peter sighed i cant contradict you there but i must go on as i can it is not always may you are not old enough for the pose you take thats what puzzles me for so many years you never seemed to grow at all older though i did two years ago you were an impetuous young man now you save yourself in everything youre naturally warm and affectionate all at once you begin shutting yourself away from everybody i dont think youll be happier for it up to this point she had been lecturing him now she suddenly crossed the room and sat down on the arm of his chair looking into his face and twisting up the ends of his military eyebrows with her thumb and middle finger why is it godfrey i cant see any change in your face though i watch you so closely its in your mind in your mood something has come over you is it merely that you know too much i wonder too much to be happy you were always the wisest person in the world what is it cant you tell me i cant altogether tell myself lillian its not wholly a matter of the calendar its the feeling that ive put a great deal behind me where i cant go back to it againand i dont really wish to go back the way would be too long and too fatiguing perhaps for a homestaying man ive lived pretty hard i wasnt willing to slight anythingyou or my desk or my students and now i seem to be tremendously tired one pays coming or going a man has got only just so much in him when its gone he slumps even the first napoleon did they both laughed that was an old jokethe professors darkest secret at the font he had been christened napoleon godfrey st peter there had always been a napoleon in the family since a remote grandfather got his discharge from the grande armeacutee godfrey had abbreviated his name in kansas and even his daughters didnt know what it had been originally i think you know he told his wife as he rose to go to bed that ill get my second wind but for the present i dont want anything very stimulating paris is too beautiful and too full of memories     chapter 16   one saturday morning in the spring when the professor was at work in the old house he heard energetic footsteps running up the uncarpeted stairway louies voice called cher papa shall i disturb you too much st peter rose and opened to him louie was wearing his golf stockings and a purple jacket with a fur collar no im not going golfing i changed my mind but didnt have time to change my clothes i want you to take a run out along the lakeshore with us rosie is going to lunch with some friends at the country club well have a drive with her and then drop her there its a glorious day louies keen interested eye ran about the shabby little room he chuckled the old bear he just likes his old den doesnt he i can readily understand your children were born here not your daughtersyour sons your splendid spanishadventurer sons im proud to be related to them even by marriage and your blanket surely thats a spanish touch louie pounced upon the purple blanket threw it across his chest and moving aside the wire lady studied himself in augustas glass and a very proper dressinggown it would make for louie wouldnt it it was outlandsa precious possession his lost chum brought it up from mexico was it outlands indeed louie stroked it and regarded it in the glass with increased admiration i can never forgive destiny that i hadnt the chance to know that splendid fellow the professors eyebrows rose in puzzled interrogation it might have been awkwardabout rosie you know i never think of him as a rival said louie throwing back the blanket with a wide gesture i think of him as a brother an adored and gifted brother half an hour later they were spinning along through the country just coming green rosamond and her father on the back seat louie facing them it struck the professor that louie had something on his mind his restless bright eyes watched his wife narrowly as if to seize an opportune moment you know doctor he said presently weve decided to give up our house before we go abroad and cut off the rent well move the books and pictures up to outland and our wedding presents of course and the silver well put in the bank there wont be much of our present furniture that well need i wonder if you could use any of it and it has just occurred to me rosie here he leaned forward and tapped her knee that we might ask scott and kathleen to come round and select anything they like no use bothering to sell it wed get so little rosamond looked at him in astonishment it was very evident they had not discussed anything of this sort before dont be foolish louie she said quietly they wouldnt want your things but why not he persisted playfully they are very nice things not right for outland but perfectly right for a little house we chose them with care and we dont want them going into some dirty secondhand shop they wont have to we can store them in the attic at outland heaven knows its big enough you dont have to do anything with them just now it seems a pity when somebody might be getting the good of them i know scott could do very well with that chiffonier of mine he admired it greatly i remember and said hed never had one with proper drawers for his shirts rosamonds lip curled dont look like that rosie its naughty stop it louie reached forward and shook her gently by the elbows and how can you be sure the mcgregors wouldnt like our things when youve never asked them what positive ideas she does get into her head they wouldnt want them because they are ours yours and mine if you will have it she said coldly drawing away from him louie sank back into his seat and gave it up why do you think such naughty things i dont believe it you know you are so touchy scott and kitty may be a little standoffish but it might very possibly make them feel better if you went at them nicely about this he rallied and began to coax again shes got it into her head that the mcgregors have a grudge doctor theres nothing to it rosamond had grown quite pale her upper lip that was so like her mothers when she was affable so much harder when she was not came down like a steel curtain i happen to know louie that scott blackballed you for the arts and letters you can call that a grudge or not as you please marsellus was visibly shaken he looked sad well if he did it wasnt very nice of him certainly but are you sure rosie rumours do go about and people like to stir up family differences it isnt people and its not rumour i know it positively kathleens best friend told me louie lay back and shook with laughter oh the ladies the ladies what they do to each other professor st peter was very uncomfortable i dont think id accept such evidence rosamond i dont believe it of scott and i think louie has the right idea people are like children and scotts poor and proud i think louies chiffonier would go to his heart if louie offered it to him im afraid you wouldnt do it very graciously professor ill go to mcgregors office and put it up to him if he scorns it so much the worse for him hell lose a very handy piece of furniture rosamonds paleness changed to red fortunately they were spinning over the gravel loops that led through shaven turf to the country club you can do as you like with your own things louie but i dont want any of mine in the mcgregors bungalow i know scotts brand of humour too well and the kind of jokes that would be made about them the car stopped louie sprang out and gave his arm to his wife he walked up the steps to the door with her and his back expressed such patient protecting kindness that the professor bit his lower lip with indignation louie came back looking quite grey and tired and sank into the seat beside the professor with a sadderandwiser smile louie st peter spoke with deep feeling do you happen to have read a novel of henry james the american theres rather a nice scene in it in which a young frenchman hurt in a duel apologizes for the behaviour of his family id like to do something of the sort i apologize to you for rosamond and for scott if he has done such a mean thing louies downcast face brightened at once he squeezed the professors arm warmly oh thats all right sir as for scott i can understand he was the first son of the family and he was the whole thing then i came along a stranger and carried off rosie and this patent began to pay so wellits enough to make any man jealous and he a scotchman but i think scott will come around in the end people usually do if you treat them well and i mean to i like the fellow as for rosamond you mustnt give that a thought i love her when shes naughty shes a bit unreasonable sometimes but im always hoping for a period of utter of fantastic unreasonableness which will be the beginning of a great happiness for us all louie you are magnanimous and magnificent murmured his vanquished fatherinlaw     chapter 17   lillian and the marselluses sailed for france early in may the professor left alone had plenty of time to spray his rosevines and his garden had never been so beautiful as it was that june after his university duties were over he smuggled his bed and clothing back to the old house and settled down to a leisurely bachelor life he realized that he ought to be getting to work the garden in which he sat all day was no longer a valid excuse to keep him from his study but the task that awaited him up there was difficult it was a little thing but one of those little things at which the hand becomes selfconscious feels itself stiff and clumsy it was his plan to give part of this summer to tom outlands diaryto edit and annotate it for publication the bother was that he must write an introduction the diary covered only about six months of the boys life a summer he spent on the blue mesa and in it there was almost nothing about tom himself to mean anything it must be prefaced by a sketch of outland and some account of his later life and achievements to write of his scientific work would be comparatively easy but that was not all the story his was a manysided mind though a simple and straightforward personality of course mrs st peter had insisted that he was not altogether straightforward but that was merely because he was not altogether consistent as an investigator he was clearsighted and hardheaded but in personal relations he was apt to be exaggerated and quixotic he idealized the people he loved and paid his devoir to the ideal rather than to the individual so that his behaviour was sometimes a little too exalted for the circumstanceschivalry of the cinema lillian used to say one of his sentimental superstitions was that he must never on any account owe any material advantage to his friends that he must keep affection and advancement far apart as if they were chemicals that would disintegrate each other st peter thought this the logical result of toms strange bringingup and his early associations there is he knew this dream of selfsacrificing friendship and disinterested love down among the daylabourers the men who run the railroad trains and boats and reapers and thrashers and minedrills of the world and tom had brought it along to the university where advancement through personal influence was considered honourable it was not until outland was a senior that lillian began to be jealous of him he had been almost a member of the family for two years and she had never found fault with the boy but after the professor began to take tom up to the study and talk over his work with him began to make a companion of him then mrs st peter withdrew her favour she could change like that friendship was not a matter of habit with her and when she was through with anyone she of course found reasons for her fickleness tom she reminded her husband was far from frank though he had such an open manner he had been consistently reserved about his own affairs and she could not believe the facts he withheld were altogether creditable they had always known he had a secret something to do with the mysterious rodney blake and the bank account in new mexico upon which he was not at liberty to draw the young man must have felt the change in her for he began that winter to make his work a pretext for coming to the house less often he and st peter now met in the alcove behind the professors lecture room at the university one sunday shortly before toms commencement he came to the house to ask rosamond to go to the senior dance with him the family were having tea in the garden a few days of intensely warm weather had come on and hurried the roses into bloom rosamond happened to ask tom who sat in his white flannels fanning himself with his straw hat if spring in the southwest was as warm as this oh no he replied may is usually chilly down therebright sun but a kind of edge in the wind and cool nights last night reminded me of smothery may nights in washington mrs st peter glanced up you mean washington city i didnt know you had ever been so far east there was no denying that the young man looked uncomfortable he frowned and said in a low voice yes ive been there i suppose i dont speak of it because i havent very pleasant recollections of it how long were you there his hostess asked a winter and spring more than six months long enough to get very homesick he went away almost at once as if he were afraid of being questioned further the subject came up again a few weeks later however after toms graduation two courses were open to him he was offered an instructorship with a small salary in the physics department under dr crane and a graduate scholarship at johns hopkins university st peter strongly urged him to accept the latter one evening when the family were discussing toms prospects the professor summed up all the reasons why he ought to go to baltimore and work in the laboratory made famous by dr rowland he assured him moreover that he would find the atmosphere of an old southern city delightful yes i know something about the atmosphere tom broke out at last it is delightful but its all wrong for me it discourages me dreadfully i used to go over there when i was in washington and it always made me blue i dont believe i could ever work there but can you trust a childs impression to guide you now in such an important decision asked mrs st peter gravely i wasnt a child mrs st peter i was as much grown up as i am nowolder in some ways it was only about a year before i came here but tom you were on the section gang that year why do you mix us all up kathleen caught his hand and squeezed the knuckles together as she did when she wanted to punish him well maybe it was two years before it doesnt matter it was long enough to count for two ordinary years he muttered abstractedly again he went away abruptly and a few days later he told st peter that he had definitely accepted the instructorship under crane and would stay on in hamilton during that summer after outlands graduation st peter got to know all there was behind his reserve mrs st peter and the two girls were in colorado and the professor was alone in the house writing on volumes three and four of his history tom was carrying on some experiments of his own over in the physics laboratory he and st peter were often together in the evening and on fine afternoons they went swimming every saturday the professor turned his house over to the cleaningwoman and he and tom went to the lake and spent the day in his sailboat it was just the sort of summer st peter liked if he had to be in hamilton at all he was his own cook and had laid in a choice assortment of cheeses and light italian wines from a discriminating importer in chicago every morning before he sat down at his desk he took a walk to the market and had his pick of the fruits and salads he dined at eight oclock when he cooked a fine leg of lamb saignant well rubbed with garlic before it went into the pan then he asked outland to dinner over a dish of steaming asparagus swathed in a napkin to keep it hot and a bottle of sparkling asti they talked and watched night fall in the garden if the evening happened to be rainy or chilly they sat inside and read lucretius it was on one of those rainy nights before the fire in the diningroom that tom at last told the story he had always kept back it was nothing very incriminating nothing very remarkable a story of youthful defeat the sort of thing a boy is sensitive aboutuntil he grows older       tom outlands story     chapter 1   the thing that sidetracked me and made me so late coming to college was a somewhat unusual accident or string of accidents it began with a poker game when i was a call boy in pardee new mexico one cold clear night in the fall i started out to hunt up a freight crew that was to go out soon after midnight it was just after pay day and one of the fellows had tipped me off that there would be a poker game going on in the cardroom behind the ruby light saloon i knew most of my crew would be there except conductor willis who had a sick baby at home the front windows were dark of course i went up the back alley through a tumbledown ice house and a court into a dobe room that didnt open into the saloon proper at all it was crowded and hot and stuffy enough there were six or seven in the game and a crowd of fellows were standing about the walls rubbing the whitewash off on to their coat shoulders there was a birdcage hanging in one window covered with an old flannel shirt but the canary had wakened up and was singing away for dear life he was a beautiful singeran old mexican had trained himand he was one of the attractions of the place i happened along when a jackpot was running two of the fellows id come for were in it and they naturally wanted to finish the hand i stood by the door with my watch keeping time for them among the players i saw two sheep men who always liked a lively game and one of the bystanders told me you had to buy a hundred dollars worth of chips to get in that night the crowd was fussing about one fellow rodney blake who had come in from his engine without cleaning up that wasnt customary the minute a man got in from his run he took a bath put on citizens clothes and went to the barber this blake was a new fireman on our division hed come up town in his greasy overalls and sweaty blue shirt with his face streaked up with smoke hed been drinking he smelled of it and his eyes were out of focus all the other men were clean and freshly shaved and they were sore at blakesaid his hands were so greasy they marked the cards some of them wanted to put him out of the game but he was a big heavybuilt fellow and nobody wanted to be the man to do it it didnt please them any better when he took the jackpot i got my two men and hurried them out and two others from the row along the wall took their places one of the chaps who left with me asked me to go up to his house and get his grip with his work clothes hes lost every cent of his pay cheque and didnt want to face his wife i asked him who was winning blake the dirty boomers been taking everything but the fellows will clean him out before morning about two oclock when my work for that night was over and i was going home to sleep i just dropped in at the cardroom to see how things had come out the game was breaking up since i left them at midnight they had changed to stud poker and blake the fireman had cleaned everybody out he was cashing in his chips when i came in the bank was a little short but blake made no fuss about it he had something over sixteen hundred dollars lying on the table before him in banknotes and gold some of the crowd were insulting him trying to get him into a fight and loot him he paid no attention and began to put the money away not looking at anybody the bills he folded and put inside the band of his hat he filled his overall pockets with the gold and swept the rest of it into his big red neckerchief id been interested in this fellow ever since he came on our division he was closemouthed and unfriendly he was one of those fellows with a settled mature body and a young face such as you often see among workingmen there was something calm and sarcastic and mocking about his expressionthat too you often see among workingmen when he had put all his money away he got up and walked toward the door without a word without saying goodnight to anybody manners of a hog and a dirty hog little barney shea yelled after him blakes back was just in the doorway he hitched up one shoulder but didnt turn or make a sound i slipped out after him and followed him down the street his walk was unsteady and the gold in his baggy overalls pockets clinked with every step he took i ran a little way and caught up with him what are you going to do with all that money blake i asked him lose it tomorrow night im no hog for money damned barberpole dudes i thought id better follow him home i knew he lodged with an old mexican woman in the yellow quarter behind the roundhouse his room opened on to the street by a skyblue door he went in didnt strike a light or make a stab at undressing but threw himself just as he was on the bed and went to sleep his hat stuck between the iron rods of the bedhead the gold ran out of his pockets and rolled over the bare floor in the dark i struck a match and lit a candle the bed took up half the room on the dresser was a grip with his clean clothes in it just as hed brought it in from his run i took out the clothes and began picking up the money got the bills out of his hat emptied his pockets and collected the coins that lay in the hollow of the bed about his hips and put it all into the grip then i blew out the light and sat down to listen i trusted all the boys who were at the ruby light that night except barney shea he might try to pull something off on a stranger down in mexican town we had a quiet night however and a cold one i found blakes winter overcoat hanging on the wall and wrapped up in it i wasnt a bit sorry when the roosters began to crow and the dogs began barking all over mexican town at last the sun came up and turned the desert and the dobe town red in a minute i began to shake the man on the bed waking men who didnt want to get up was part of my job and i didnt let up on him until i had him on his feet hello kid come to call on me i told him id come to call him to a harvey house breakfast you owe me a good one i brought you home last night sure im glad to have company wait till i wash up a bit he took his soap and towel and comb and went out into the patio a neat little sanded square with flowers and vines all around and washed at the trough under the pump then he called me to come and pump water on his head after hed stood the gush of cold water for a few seconds he straightened up with his teeth chattering that ought to get the whisky out of a fellows head oughtnt it felt good tom presently he began feeling his side pockets was i dreaming something or did i take a string of jackpots last night the moneys in your grip i told him you dont deserve it for you were too drunk to take care of it i had to come after you and pick it up out of the mud all right ill go halvers easy come easy go i told him i didnt want anything off him but breakfast and i wanted that pretty soon go easy son ive got to change my shirt this ones wet its worse than wet you oughtnt to go up town without changing youre a stranger here and it makes a bad impression he shrugged his shoulders and looked superior he had a squarebuilt honest face and steady eyes that didnt carry a cynical expression very well i knew he was a decent chap though hed been drinking and acting ugly ever since hed been on our division after breakfast we went out and sat in the sun at a place where the wooden sidewalk ran over a sand gully and made a sort of bridge i had a long talk with him i was carrying the grip with his winnings in it and i finally persuaded him to go with me to the bank we put every cent of it into a savings account that he couldnt touch for a year from that night blake and i were fast friends he was the sort of fellow who can do anything for somebody else and nothing for himself there are lots like that among workingmen they arent trained by success to a sort of systematic selfishness rodney had been unlucky in personal relations hed run away from home when he was a kid because his mother married againa man who had been paying attention to her while his father was still alive he got engaged to a girl down on the southern pacific and she doublecrossed him as he said he went to old mexico and let his friends put all his savings into an oil well and they skinned him what he needed was a pal a straight fellow to give an account to i was ten years younger and that was an advantage he liked to be an older brother i suppose the fact that i was a kind of stray and had no family made it easier for him to unbend to me he surely got to think a lot of me and i did of him it was that winter i had pneumonia mrs obrien couldnt do much for me she was overworked poor woman with a houseful of children blake took me down to his room and he and the old mexican woman nursed me he ought to have had boys of his own to look after natures full of such substitutions but they always seem to me sad even in botany i wasnt able to be about until spring and then the doctor and father duchene said i must give up night work and live in the open all summer before i knew anything about it blake had thrown up his job on the santa feacute and got a berth for him and me with the sitwell cattle company jonas sitwell was one of the biggest cattle men in our part of new mexico roddy and i were to ride the range with a bunch of grass cattle all summer then take them down to a winter camp on the cruzados river and keep them on pasture until spring we went out about the first of may and joined our cattle twenty miles south of pardee down toward the blue mesa the blue mesa was one of the landmarks we always saw from pardeelandmarks mean so much in a flat country to the northwest over toward utah we had the mormon buttes three sharp blue peaks that always sat there the blue mesa was south of us and was much stronger in colour almost purple people said the rock itself had a deep purplish cast it looked from our town like a naked blue rock set down alone in the plain almost square except that the top was higher at one end the old settlers said nobody had ever climbed it because the sides were so steep and the cruzados river wound round it at one end and undercut it blake and i knew that the sitwell winter camp was down on the cruzados river directly under the mesa and all summer long while we drifted about with our cattle from one waterhole to another we planned how we were going to climb the mesa and be the first men up there after supper when we lit our pipes and watched the sunset climbing the mesa was our staple topic of conversation our job was a cinch the actual work wouldnt have kept one man busy the sitwell people were good to their hands john rapp the foreman came along once a month in his springwagon to see how the cattle were doing and to bring us supplies and bundles of old newspapers blake was conscientious reader of newspapers he always wanted to know what was going on in the world though most of it displeased him he brooded on the great injustices of his time the hanging of the anarchists in chicago which he could just remember and the dreyfus case we had long arguments about what we read in the papers but we never quarrelled the only trouble i had with blake was in getting to do my share of the work he made my health a pretext for taking all the heavy chores long after i was as well as he was id brought my caesar along and had promised father duchene to read a hundred lines a day blake saw that i did itmade me translate the dull stuff aloud to him he said if i once knew latin i wouldnt have to work with my back all my life like a burro he had great respect for education but he believed it was some kind of hocuspocus that enabled a man to live without work we had robinson crusoe with us and roddys favourite book gullivers travels which he never tired of late in october rapp the foreman came along to accompany us down to the winter camp blake stayed with the cattle about fifteen miles to the east where the grass was still good and rapp and i went down to air out the cabin and stow away our winter supplies     chapter 2   the cabin stood in a little grove of pintildeons about thirty yards back from the cruzados river facing south and sheltered on the north by a low hill the grama grass grew right up to the doorstep and the rabbits were running about and the grasshoppers hitting the door when we pulled up and looked at the place there was no litter around it was as clean as a prairiedogs house no outbuildings except a shed for our horses the hillside behind was sandy and covered with tall clumps of deerhorn cactus but there was nothing but grass to the south with streaks of bright yellow rabbitbrush along the river the cottonwoods and quaking asps had already turned gold just across from us overhanging us indeed stood the mesa a pile of purple rock all broken out with red sumach and yellow aspens up in the high crevices of the cliffs from the cabin night and day you could hear the river where it made a bend round the foot of the mesa and churned over the rocks it was the sort of place a man would like to stay in forever i helped rapp open the wooden shutters and sweep out the cabin we put clean blankets on the bunks and stowed away bacon and coffee and canned stuff on the shelves behind the cookstove i confess i looked forward to cooking on an iron stove with four holes rapp explained to me that blake and i wouldnt be able to enjoy all this luxury together for a time he wanted the herd kept some distance to the north as long as the grass held out up there and roddy and i could take turn about one camping near the cattle and one sleeping in a bed theres not pasture enough down here to take them through a long winter he said and its safest to keep them grazing up north while you can besides if you bring them down here while the weathers so warm they get skittish and that mesa over there makes trouble they swim the river and bolt into the mesa and thats the last you ever see of them weve lost a lot of critters that way the mesa has been populated by runaways from our herd till now theres a fine bunch of wild cattle up there when the winds right our cows over here get the scent of them and make a break for the river youll have to watch em close when you bring em down i asked him whether nobody had ever gone over to get the lost cattle out rapp glared at me out of that mesa nobody has ever got into it yet the cliffs are like the base of a monument all the way round the only way in is through that deep canyon that opens on the water level just where the river makes the bend you cant get in by that because the rivers too deep to ford and too swift to swim oh i suppose a horse could swim it if cattle can but i dont want to be the man to try i remarked that i had had my eye on the mesa all summer and meant to climb it not while youre working for the sitwell company you dont if you boys try any nonsense of that sort ill fire you quick youd break your bones and lose the herd for us you have to watch them close to keep them from going over i tell you if it wasnt for that mesa this would be the best winter range in all new mexico after the foreman left us we settled down to easy living and fine weather blue and gold days and clear frosty nights we kept the cattle off to the north and east and alternated in taking charge of them one man was with the herd while the other got his sleep and did the cooking at the cabin the mesa was our only neighbour and the closer we got to it the more tantalizing it was it was no longer a blue featureless lump as it had been from a distance its skyline was like the profile of a big beast lying down the head to the north higher than the flanks around which the river curved the north end we could easily believe impassablesheer cliffs that fell from the summit to the plain more than a thousand feet but the south flank just across the river from us looked accessible by way of the deep canyon that split the bulk in two from the top rim to the river then wound back into the solid cube so that it was invisible at a distance like a mouse track winding into a big cheese this canyon didnt break the solid outline of the mesa and you had to be close to see that it was there at all we faced the mesa on its shortest side it was only about three miles long from north to south but east and west it measured nearly twice that distance whether the top was wooded we couldnt seeit was too high above us but the cliffs and canyon on the river side were fringed with beautiful growth groves of quaking asps and pintildeons and a few dark cedars perched up in the air like the hanging gardens of babylon at certain hours of the day those cedars growing so far up on the rocks took on the bluish tint of the cliffs themselves it was light up there long before it was with us when i got up at daybreak and went down to the river to get water our camp would be cold and grey but the mesa top would be red with sunrise and all the slim cedars along the rocks would be goldmetallic like tarnished goldfoil some mornings it would loom up above the dark river like a blazing volcanic mountain it shortened our days too considerably the sun got behind it early in the afternoon and then our camp would lie in its shadow after a while the sunset colour would begin to stream up from behind it then the mesa was like one great inkblack rock against a sky on fire no wonder the thing bothered us and tempted us it was always before us and was always changing black thunderstorms used to roll up from behind it and pounce on us like a panther without warning the lightning would play round it and jab into it so that we were always expecting it would fire the brush ive never heard thunder so loud as it was there the cliffs threw it back at us and we thought the mesa itself though it seemed so solid must be full of deep canyons and caverns to account for the prolonged growl and rumble that followed every crash of thunder after the burst in the sky was over the mesa went on sounding like a drum and seemed itself to be muttering and making noises one afternoon i was out hunting turkeys just as the sun was getting low i came through a sea of rabbitbrush still yellow and the horizontal rays of light playing into it brought out the contour of the ground with great distinctness i noticed a number of straight mounds like plough furrows running from the river inland it was too late to examine them i cut a scrub willow and stuck a stake into one of the ridges to mark it the next day i took a spade down to the plantation of rabbitbrush and dug around the sandy soil i came upon an old irrigation main unmistakable lined with hard smooth cobbles and dobe cement with sluices where the water had been let out into the trenches along these ditches i turned up some pieces of pottery all of it broken and arrowheads and a very neat wellfinished stone pickax that night i didnt go back to the cabin but took my specimens out to blake who was still north with the cattle of course we both knew there had been indians all over this country but we felt sure that indians hadnt used stone tools for a long while back there must have been a colony of pueblo indians here in ancient time fixed residents like the taos indians and the hopis not wanderers like the navajos to people off alone as we were there is something stirring about finding evidences of human labour and care in the soil of an empty country it comes to you as a sort of message makes you feel differently about the ground you walk over every day i liked the winter range better than any place id ever been in i never came out of the cabin door in the morning to go after water that i didnt feel fresh delight in our snug quarters and the river and the old mesa up there with its top burning like a bonfire i wanted to see what it was like on the other side and very soon i took a day off and forded the river where it was wide and shallow north of our camp i rode clear around the mesa until i met the river again where it flowed under the south flank on that ride i got a better idea of its actual structure all the way round were the same precipitous cliffs of hard blue rock but in places it was mixed with a much softer stone in these soft streaks there were deep dry watercourses which could certainly be climbed as far as they went but nowhere did they reach to the top of the mesa the top seemed to be one great slab of very hard rock lying on the mixed mass of the base like the top of an oldfashioned marble table the channels worn out by water ran for hundreds of feet up the cliffs but always stopped under this great rimrock which projected out over the erosions like a granite shelf evidently it was because of this unbroken top layer that the butte was inaccessible i rode back to camp that night convinced that if we ever climbed it we must take the route the cattle took through the river and up the one canyon that broke down to waterlevel     chapter 3   we brought the bunch of cattle down to the winter range in the latter part of november early in december the foreman came along with generous provisions for christmas this time he brought with him a supercargo a pitiful wreck of an old man he had picked up at tarpin the railroad town thirty miles northeast of us where the sitwells bought their supplies this old man was a castaway englishman henry atkins by name he had been a valet and a hospital orderly and a cook and for many years was a table steward on the anchor line lately he had been cooking for a sheep outfit that were grazing in the cattle country were they werent wanted they had done something shady and had to get out in a hurry they dropped old henry at tarpin where he soon drank up all his wages when rapp picked him up there he was living on handouts ive told him we cant pay him anything rapp explained but if he wants to stay here and cook for you boys till i make my next trip hell have plenty to eat and a roof over him he was sleeping in the livery stable in tarpin he says hes a good cook and i thought he might liven things up for you at christmas time he wont bother you hes not got any of the mean ways of a bumi know a bum when i see one next time i come down ill bring him some old clothes from the ranch and you can fire him if you want to all his baggage is that newspaper bundle and theres nothing in it but shoesa pair of patent leathers and a pair of sneakers the important thing is never on any account go off skylarking you two and leave him with the cattle not for an hour mind you he aint strong enough and hes got no head life was a holiday for blake and me after we got old henry he was a wonderful cook and a good housekeeper he kept that cabin shining like a playhouse used to dress it all out with pintildeon boughs and trimmed the kitchen shelves with newspapers cut in fancy patterns he had learned to make up cots when he was a hospital orderly and he made our bunks feel like a harvey house bed to this day thats the best i can say for any bed and he was such a polite mannerly old boy simple and kind as a child i used to wonder how anybody so innocent and defenceless had managed to get along at all to keep alive for nearly seventy years in as hard a world as this anybody could take advantage of him he held no grudge against any of the people who had misused him he loved to tell about the celebrated people hed been steward to and the liberal tips they had given him there with us where he couldnt get at whisky he was a model of good behaviour drink is me weakness you might say he occasionally remarked apologetically he shaved every morning and was as clean as a pin we got to be downright fond of him and the three of us made a happy family ever since wed brought our herd down to the winter camp the wild cattle on the mesa were more in evidence they came down to the river to drink oftener and loitered about grazing in that low canyon so much that we began to call it cow canyon they were finelooking beasts too one could see they had good pasture up there henry had a theory that we ought to be able to entice them over to our side with salt he wanted to kill one for beefsteaks soon after he joined us we lost two cows without warning they bolted into the mesa as the foreman had said after that we watched the herd closer but a few days before christmas when blake was off hunting and i was on duty four fine young steers sneaked down to the waters edge through the brush and before i knew it they were swimming the riverseemed to do it with no trouble at all they frisked out on the other side ambled up the canyon and disappeared i was furious to have them steal a march on me and i swore to myself id follow them over and drive them back the next morning we took the herd a few miles east to keep them out of mischief i made some excuse to blake cut back to the cabin and asked henry to put me up a lunch i told him my plan but warned him not to bear tales if i wasnt home when blake came in at night then he could tell him where id gone henry went down to the river with me to watch me across it had grown colder since morning and looked like snow the old man was afraid of a storm said i might get snowed in but id got my nerve up and i didnt want to put off making a try at it i strapped my blanket and my lunch on my shoulders hung my boots around my neck to keep them dry stuffed my socks inside my hat and we waded in my horse took the water without any fuss though he shivered a good deal he stepped out very carefully and when it got too deep for him he swam without panic we were carried downstream a little by the current but i didnt have to slide off his back he found bottom after a while and we easily made a landing i waved goodbye to henry on the other side and started up the canyon running beside my horse to get warm the canyon was wide at the waters edge and though it corkscrewed back into the mesa by abrupt turns it preserved this open roomy character it was indeed a very deep valley with gently sloping sides rugged and rocky but well grassed there was a clear trail horses have no sense about making a trail but you can trust cattle to find the easiest possible path and to take the lowest grades the bluish rock and the suntanned grass under the unusual purplegrey of the sky gave the whole valley a very soft colour lavender and pale gold so that the occasional cedars growing beside the boulders looked black that morning it may have been the hint of snow in the air but it seemed to me that i had never breathed in anything that tasted so pure as the air in that valley it made my mouth and nostrils smart like charged water seemed to go to my head a little and produce a kind of exaltation i kept telling myself that it was very different from the air on the other side of the river though that was pure and uncontaminated enough when i had gone up this canyon for a mile or so i came upon another opening out to the northa box canyon very different in character no gentle slope there the walls were perpendicular where they werent actually overhanging and they were anywhere from eight hundred to a thousand feet high as we afterward found by measurement the floor of it was a mass of huge boulders great pieces of rock that had fallen from above ages back and had been worn round and smooth as pebbles by the long action of water many of them were as big as haystacks yet they lay piled on one another like a load of gravel there was no footing for my horse among those smooth stones so i hobbled him and went on alone a little way just to see what it was like my eyes were steadily on the grounda slip of the foot there might cripple one it was such rough scrambling that i was soon in a warm sweat under my damp clothes in stopping to take breath i happened to glance up at the canyon wall i wish i could tell you what i saw there just as i saw it on that first morning through a veil of lightly falling snow far up above me a thousand feet or so set in a great cavern in the face of the cliff i saw a little city of stone asleep it was as still as sculptureand something like that it all hung together seemed to have a kind of composition pale little houses of stone nestling close to one another perched on top of each other with flat roofs narrow windows straight walls and in the middle of the group a round tower it was beautifully proportioned that tower swelling out to a larger girth a little above the base then growing slender again there was something symmetrical and powerful about the swell of the masonry the tower was the fine thing that held all the jumble of houses together and made them mean something it was red in colour even on that grey day in sunlight it was the colour of winter oakleaves a fringe of cedars grew along the edge of the cavern like a garden they were the only living things such silence and stillness and reposeimmortal repose that village sat looking down into the canyon with the calmness of eternity the falling snowflakes sprinkling the pintildeons gave it a special kind of solemnity i cant describe it it was more like sculpture than anything else i knew at once that i had come upon the city of some extinct civilization hidden away in this inaccessible mesa for centuries preserved in the dry air and almost perpetual sunlight like a fly in amber guarded by the cliffs and the river and the desert as i stood looking up at it i wondered whether i ought to tell even blake about it whether i ought not to go back across the river and keep that secret as the mesa had kept it when i at last turned away i saw still another canyon branching out of this one and in its was still another arch with another group of buildings the notion struck me like a rifle ball that this mesa had once been like a beehive it was full of little cliffhung villages it had been the home of a powerful tribe a particular civilization that night when i got home blake was on the riverbank waiting for me i told him id rather not talk about my trip until after supperthat i was beat out i think hed meant to upbraid me for sneaking off but he didnt he seemed to realize from the first that this was a serious matter to me and he accepted it in that way after supper when we had lit our pipes i told blake and henry as clearly as i could what it was like over there and we talked it over the town in the cliffs explained the irrigation ditches like all pueblo indians these people had had their farms away from their dwellings for a stronghold they needed rock and for farming soft earth and a water main and this proves said roddy that there must have been a trail into the mesa at the north end and that they carried their harvest over by the ford if this cow canyon was the only entrance they could never have farmed down here we agreed that he should go over on the first warm day and try to find a trail up to the cliff city as we already called it we talked and speculated until after midnight it was christmas eve and henry said it was but right we should do something out of the ordinary but after we went to bed tired as i was i was unable to sleep i got up and dressed and put on my overcoat and slipped outside to get sight of the mesa the wind had come up and was blowing the squall clouds across the sky the moon was almost full hanging directly over the mesa which had never looked so solemn and silent to me before i wondered how many christmases had come and gone since that round tower was built i had been to acoma and the hopi villages but id never seen a tower like that one it seemed to me to mark a difference i felt that only a strong and aspiring people would have built it and a people with a feeling for design that cluster of buildings in its arch with the dizzy drop into empty air from its doorways and the wall of cliff above was as clear in my mind as a picture by closing my eyes i could see it against the dark like a magiclantern slide blake got over the river before new years day but he didnt find any way of getting from the bottom of the box canyon up into the cliff city he felt sure that the inhabitants of that sky village had reached it by a trail from the top of the mesa down not from the bottom of the canyon up he explored the branch canyons a little and found four other villages smaller than the first placed in similar arches these arches we had often seen in other canyons you can find them in the grand canyon and all along the rio grande whenever the surface rock is much harder than the rock beneath it the softer stone begins to crack and crumble with weather just at the line where it meets the hard rim rock it goes on crumbling and falling away and in time this washout grows to be a spacious cavern the cliff city sat in an unusually large cavern we afterward found that it was three hundred and sixty feet long and seventy feet high in the centre the red tower was fifty feet in height blake and i began to make plans our engagement with the sitwell company terminated in may when we turned our cattle over to the foreman we would go into the mesa with what food and tools we could carry and try to find a trail down the north end where we were sure there must once have been one if we could find an easier way to get in and out of the mesa we would devote the summer and our winters wages to exploring it from tarpin the nearest railroad we could get supplies and tools and help if we needed it we thought we could manage to do the work ourselves if old henry would stay with us we didnt want to make our discovery any more public than necessary we were reluctant to expose those silent and beautiful places to vulgar curiosity finally we outlined our plan to henry telling him we couldnt promise him regular wages we wont mention it he said waving his hand id ask nothing better than to share your fortunes in me youth it was me ambition to go to egypt and see the tombs of the pharaohs you may get a bad cold going over the river henry blake warned him its a bad crossingmakes you dizzy when you take to swimming you have to keep your head i was never seasick in me life he declared and at that ive helped in the cooks galley on the anchor line when she was fair standing on her head youll find me strong and active when im once broke into the work i come of an enduring family though to be sure ive abused me constitution somewhat henry liked to talk about his family and the work theyd done and the great age to which they lived and the brandy puddings his mother made eighteen we was in all when we sat down at table he would often say with his thin apologetic smile mother and father and ten living and four dead and two stillborn roddy and i used to strain our imagination trying to visualize such a family dinner party everything worked out well for us the foreman showed so much interest in our plans that we told him everything he insisted that we should stay on at the winter camp as long as we needed a home base and use up whatever supplies were left when he paid us off he sold us our two horses at a very reasonable figure     chapter 4   blake and i got over to the mesa together for the first time early in may we carried with us all the food we could and an ax and spade it took us several days to find a trail leading from the bottom of the box canyon up to the cliff city there were gaps in it it was broken by ledges too steep for a man to climb lying beside one of these we found an old dried cedar trunk with toenotches cut in it that was a plain suggestion we felled some trees and threw them up over the gaps in the path toward the end of the week when our provisions were getting low we made the last lap in our climb and stepped upon the ledge that was the floor of the cliff city in front of the cluster of buildings there was an open space like a courtyard along the outer edge of this yard ran a low stone wall in some places the wall had fallen away from the weather but the buildings themselves sat so far back under the rim rock that the rain had never beat on them in thunderstorms ive seen the water come down in sheets over the face of that cavern without a drop touching the village the courtyard was not choked by vegetation for there was no soil it was bare rock with a few old flattopped cedars growing out of the cracks and a little pale grass but everything seemed open and clean and the stones i remember were warm to the touch smooth and pleasant to feel the outer walls of the houses were intact except where sometimes an outjutting corner had crumbled they were made of dressed stones plastered inside and out with dobe and were tinted in light colours pink and pale yellow and tan here and there a cedar log in the ceiling had given way and let the secondstory chamber down into the first except for that there was little rubbish or disorder as blake remarked wind and sun are good housekeepers this village had never been sacked by an enemy certainly inside the little rooms water jars and bowls stood about unbroken and yuccafibre mats were on the floors we could give only a hurried look over the place as our food was exhausted and we had to get back over the river before dark we went about softly tried not to disturb anythingeven the silence besides the tower there seemed to be about thirty little separate dwellings behind the cluster of houses was a kind of back courtyard running from end to end of the cavern a long low twilit space that got gradually lower toward the back until the rim rock met the floor of the cavern exactly like the sloping roof of an attic there was perpetual twilight back there cool shadowy very grateful after the blazing sun in the front courtyard when we entered it we heard a soft trickling sound and we came upon a spring that welled out of the rock into a stone basin and then ran off through a cobblelined gutter and dripped down the cliffs ive never anywhere tasted water like it as cold as ice and so pure long afterward father duchene came out to spend a week with us on the mesa he always carried a small drinkingglass with him and he used to fill it at the spring and take it out into the sunlight the water looked like liquid crystal absolutely colourless without the slight brownish or greenish tint that water nearly always has it threw off the sunlight like a diamond beside this spring stood some of the most beautifully shaped water jars we ever foundi gave mrs st peter one of themstanding there just as if theyd been left yesterday in the back court we found a great many things besides jars and bowls a row of grinding stones and several clay ovens very much like those the mexicans use today there were charred bones and charcoal and the roof was thick with soot all the way along it was evidently a kind of common kitchen where they roasted and baked and probably gossiped there were corncobs everywhere and ears of corn with the kernels still on themlittle like popcorn we found dried beans too and strings of pumpkin seeds and plum seeds and a cupboard full of little implements made of turkey bones late that afternoon roddy and i crossed the river and got back to our cabin to rest for a few days the second time we went over we found a long winding trail leading from the cliff city up to the top of the mesaa narrow path worn deep into the stone ledges that overhung the village then running back into the wood of stunted pintildeons on the summit following this to the north end of the mesa we found what was left of an old road down to the plain but making this road passable was a matter of weeks and we had to get workmen and tools from tarpin it was a narrow footpath barely wide enough for a surefooted mule and it wound down through black canyon dropping in loops along the face of terrifying cliffs about a hundred feet above the river it endedbroke right off into the air a wall of rock had fallen away there probably from a landslide that last piece of road cost us three weeks hard work and most of our winters wages we kept the workmen on long enough to build us a tight log cabin on the mesa top a little way back from the ledge that hung over the cliff city while we were engaged in roadbuilding we made a short cut from our cabin down to the cliff city and cow canyon just over the cliff city there was a crack in the ledge a sort of manhole and in this we hung a ladder of pinetrunks spliced together with light chains leaving the branch forks for footholds by climbing down this ladder we saved about two miles of winding trails and dropped almost directly into cow canyon where we meant always to leave one of the horses grazing taking this route we could at any time make a quick exit from the mesawe were used to swimming the river now and in summer our wet clothes dried very quickly bill hook the liveryman at tarpin whod sheltered old henry when he was down and out proved a good friend to us he got our workmen back and forth for us brought our supplies up on to the mesa on his packmules and when one of us had to stay in town overnight he let us sleep in his hay barn to save a hotel bill he knew our expenses were heavy and did everything for us at bottom price by the first of july our money was nearly gone but we had our road made and our cabin built on top of the mesa we brought old henry up by the new horsetrail and began housekeeping we were now ready for what we called excavating we built wide shelves all around our sleepingroom and there we put the smaller articles we found in the cliff city we numbered each specimen and in my daybook i wrote down just where and in what condition we had found it and what we thought it had been used for id got a merchants ledger in tarpin and every night after supper while roddy read the newspapers i sat down at the kitchen table and wrote up an account of the days work henry besides doing the housekeeping was very eager to help us in the rewins as he called them he was more patient than we and would dig with his fingers half a day to get a pot out of a rubbish pile without breaking it after all the old man had a wider knowledge of the world than either of us and it often came in handy when we were working in a pale pink house with two stories and a sort of balcony before the upper windows we came on a closet in the wall of the upstairs room in this were a number of curious thing among them a deerskin bag full of little tools henry said at once they were surgical instruments a stone lancet a bunch of fine bone needles wooden forceps and a catheter one thing we knew about these people they hadnt built their town in a hurry everything proved their patience and deliberation the cedar joists had been felled with stone axes and rubbed smooth with sand the little poles that lay across them and held up the clay floor of the chamber above were smoothly polished the door lintels were carefully fitted the doors were stone slabs held in place by wooden bars fitted into hasps the clay dressing that covered the stone walls was tinted and some of the chambers were frescoed in geometrical patterns one colour laid on another in one room was a painted border little tents like indian tepees in brilliant red but the really splendid thing about our city the thing that made it delightful to work there and must have made it delightful to live there was the setting the town hung like a birds nest in the cliff looking off into the box canyon below and beyond into the wide valley we called cow canyon facing an ocean of clear air a people who had the hardihood to build there and who lived day after day looking down upon such grandeur who came and went by those hazardous trails must have been as we often told each other a fine people but what had become of them what catastrophe had overwhelmed them they hadnt moved away for they had taken none of their belongings not even their clothes oh yes we found clothes yucca moccasins and what seemed like cotton cloth woven in black and white never any wool but sheepskins tanned with the fleece on them they may have been mountain sheep the mesa was full of them we talked of shooting one for meat but we never did when a mountain sheep comes out on a ledge hundreds of feet above you with his trumpet horns theres something noble about himhe looks like a priest we didnt want to shoot at them and make them shy we liked to see them we shot a wild cow when we wanted fresh meat at last we came upon one of the original inhabitantsnot a skeleton but a dried human body a woman she was not in the cliff city we found her in a little group of houses stuck up in a high arch we called the eagles nest she was lying on a yucca mat partly covered with rags and she had dried into a mummy in that waterdrinking air we thought she had been murdered there was a great wound in her side the ribs stuck out through the dried flesh her mouth was open as if she were screaming and her face through all those years had kept a look of terrible agony part of the nose was gone but she had plenty of teeth not one missing and a great deal of coarse black hair her teeth were even and white and so little worn that we thought she must have been a young woman henry named her mother eve and we called her that we put her in a blanket and let her down with great care and kept her in a chamber in the cliff city yes we found three other bodies but afterward one day working in the cliff city we came upon a stone slab at one end of the cavern that seemed to lead straight into the rock it was set in cement and when we loosened it we found it opened into a small dark chamber in this there had been a platform of fine cedar poles laid side by side but it had crumbled in the wreckage were three bodies one man and two women wrapped in yuccafibre all in the same posture and apparently prepared for burial they were the bodies of old people we believed they were among the aged who were left behind when the tribe went down to live on their farms in the summer season that they had died in the absence of the villages and were put into this mortuary chamber to await the return of the tribe when they would have their funeral rites probably these people burned their dead of course an archaeologist could have told a great deal about that civilization from those bodies but they never got to an archaeologistat least not on this side of the world     chapter 5   the first of august came and everything was going well with us we hadnt met with any bad luck and though we had very little money left there was blakes untouched savings account in the bank at pardee and we had plenty of credit in tarpin the merchants there took an interest and were friendly but the little new moon that looked so innocent brought us trouble we lost old henry and in a terrible way from the first wed been a little bothered by rattlesnakesyou generally find them about old stone quarries and old masonry we had got them pretty well cleared out of the cliff city hadnt seen one there for weeks but one sunday we took henry and went on an exploring expedition at the north end of the mesa along black canyon we caught sight of a little bunch of ruins wed never noticed before and made a foolhardy scramble to get up to them we almost made it and then there was a stretch of rock wall so smooth we couldnt climb it without a ladder i was the tallest of the three and henry was the lightest he thought he could get up there if he stood on my shoulders he was standing on my back his head just above the floor of the cavern groping for something to hoist himself by when a snake struck him from the ledgestruck him square in the forehead it happened in a flash he came down and brought the snake with him by the time we picked him up and turned him over his face had begun to swell in ten minutes it was purple and he was so crazy it took the two of us to hold him and keep him from jumping down the chasm he was struck so near the brain that there was nothing to do it lasted nearly two hours then we carried him home roddy dropped down the ladder into cow canyon caught his horse and rode into tarpin for the coroner father duchene was preaching there at the mission church that sunday and came back with him we buried henry on the mesa father duchene stayed on with us a week to keep us company we were so cut up that we were almost ready to quit but he had been planning to come out to see our find for a long while and he got our minds off our trouble he worked hard every day he went over everything wed done and examined everything minutely the pottery cloth stone implements and the remains of food he measured the heads of the mummies and declared they had good skulls he cut down one of the old cedars that grew exactly in the middle of the deep trail worn in the stone and counted the rings under his pocket microscope you couldnt count them with the unassisted eye for growing out of a tiny crevice in the rock as that tree did the increase of each year was so scant that the rings were invisible except with a glass the tree he cut down registered three hundred and thirtysix years growth and it could have begun to grow in that wellworn path only after human feet had ceased to come and go there why had they ceased that question puzzled him too smallpox any epidemic would have left unburied bodies father duchene suggested what dr ripley in washington afterward surmised that the tribe had been exterminated not here in their stronghold but in their summer camp down among the farms across the river father duchene had been among the indians nearly twenty years then he had seventeen indian pueblos in his parish and he spoke several indian dialects he was able to explain the use of many of the implements we found especially those used in religious ceremonies the night before he left us he summed up the results of his weeks study something like this the two square towers on the mesa top to which you have given little attention were unquestionably granaries under the stones and earth fallen from the walls there is a quantity of dried corn on the ear not a great harvest for life must have come to an end here in the summer when the new crop was not yet garnered and the last years grain was getting low the semicircular ridge on the mesa top which you can see distinctly among the pintildeons when the sun is low and brings it into high relief is the buried wall of an amphitheatre where probably religious exercises and games took place i advise you not to dig into it it is probably the most important thing here and should be left for scholars to excavate the tower you so much admire in the cliff village may have been a watch tower as you think but from the curious placing of those narrow slits like windows i believe it was used for astronomical observations i am inclined to think that your tribe were a superior people perhaps they were not so when they first came upon this mesa but in an orderly and secure life they developed considerably the arts of peace there is evidence on every hand that they lived for something more than food and shelter they had an appreciation of comfort and went even further than that their life compared to that of our roving navajos must have been quite complex there is unquestionably a distinct feeling for design in what you call the cliff city buildings are not grouped like that by pure accident though convenience probably had much to do with it convenience often dictates very sound design the workmanship on both the wood and stone of the dwellings is good the shapes and decoration of the water jars and food bowls is better than in any of the existing pueblos i know better even than the pottery made at acoma i have seen a collection of early pottery from the island of crete many of the geometrical decorations on these jars are not only similar but if my memory is trustworthy identical i see your tribe as a provident rather thoughtful people who made their livelihood secure by raising crops and fowlthe great number of turkey bones and feathers are evidence that they had domesticated the wild turkey with grain in their storerooms and mountain sheep and deer for their quarry they rose gradually from the condition of savagery with the proper variation of meat and vegetable diet they developed physically and improved in the primitive arts they had looms and mills and experimented with dyes at the same time they possibly declined in the arts of war in brute strength and ferocity i see them here isolated cut off from other tribes working out their destiny making their mesa more and more worthy to be a home for man purifying life by religious ceremonies and observances caring respectfully for their dead protecting the children doubtless entertaining some feelings of affection and sentiment for this stronghold where they were at once so safe and so comfortable where they had practically overcome the worst hardships that primitive man had to fear they were perhaps too far advanced for their time and environment they were probably wiped out utterly exterminated by some roving indian tribe without culture or domestic virtues some horde that fell upon them in their summer camp and destroyed them for their hides and clothing and weapons or from mere love of slaughter i feel sure that these brutal invaders never even learned of the existence of this mesa honeycombed with habitations if they had come here they would have destroyed they killed and went their way what i cannot understand is why you have not found more human remains the three bodies you found in the mortuary chamber were prepared for burial by the old people who were left behind but what of the last survivors it is possible that when autumn wore on and no one returned from the farms the aged banded together went in search of their people and perished in the plain like you i feel reverence for this place wherever humanity has made that hardest of all starts and lifted itself out of mere brutality is a sacred spot your people were cut off here without the influence of example or emulation with no incentive but some natural yearning for order and security they built themselves into this mesa and humanized it father duchene warmly agreed with blake that i ought to go to washington and make some report to the government so that the proper specialists would be sent out to study the remains we had found you must go to the director of the smithsonian institution he said he will send us an archaeologist who will interpret all that is obscure to us he will revive this civilization in a scholarly work it may be that you will have thrown light on some important points in the history of your country after he left us blake and i began to make definite plans for my trip to washington blake was to work on the railroad that winter and save as much money as possible the expense of my journey would be paid out of what we called the jackpot account in the bank at pardee all our further expenses on the mesa would be paid by the government roddy often hinted that we would get a substantial reward of some kind when we broke or lost anything at our work he used to smile and say never mind i guess our uncle sam will make that good to us we had a beautiful autumn that year soft sunny like a dream even up there in the air we had so little wind that the gold hung on the poplars and quaking aspens late in november we stayed out on the mesa until after christmas we wanted our archaeologist when he came to find everything in good order we cleared up any litter wed made in digging things out stored all the specimens even the mummies in our cabin and padlocked the doors and windows before we left it i had written up my daybook carefully to the very end had even written out some of father duchenes deductions this book i left in concealment on the mesa i climbed up to the eagles nest in which we had found the mummy of the murdered woman we called mother eve where i had noticed a particularly neat little cupboard in the wall i put my book in this niche and sealed it up with cement mother eve had greatly interested father duchene by the way he laughed and said she was well named he didnt believe her death could throw any light on the destruction of her people i seem to smell he said slyly a personal tragedy perhaps when the tribe went down to the summer camp our lady was sick and would not go perhaps her husband thought it worth while to return unannounced from the farms some night and found her in improper company the young man may have escaped in primitive society the husband is allowed to punish an unfaithful wife with death when the first snow began to fly we said goodbye to our mesa and rode into tarpin it took several days to outfit me for my journey to washington we bought a trunk id never owned one in my life and a supply of white shirts an overcoat that was as heavy as lead and just about as cold and two suits of clothes that conscienceless trader worked off on me a clawhammer coat he must have had in stock for twenty years he easily persuaded roddy that it was the proper thing for dress occasions i think roddy expected that i would be received by ambassadorsperhaps i did roddy drew me six hundred dollars out of the bank to stake me and bought my ticket and pullman through to washington he went to the station with me the morning i left and a hard handshake was goodbye for a long while after my train pulled out i could see our mesa bulking up blue on the skyline i hated to leave it but i reflected that it had taken care of itself without me for a good many hundred years when i saw it again i told myself i would have done my duty by it i would bring back with me men who would understand it who would appreciate it and dig out all its secrets     chapter 6   i got off the train just behind the capitol building one cold bright january morning i stood for a long while watching the white dome against a flashing blue sky with a very religious feeling after i had walked about a little and seen the parks so green though it was winter and the treasury building and the war and navy i decided to put off my business for a little and give myself a week to enjoy the city that was the most sensible thing i did while i was there for that week i was wonderfully happy my sightseeing over i got to work first i went to see the representative from our district to ask for letters of introduction he was cordial enough but he gave me bad advice he was very positive that i ought to report to the indian commission and gave me a letter to the commissioner the commissioner was out of town and i wasted three days waiting about his office being questioned by clerks and secretaries they were not very busy and seemed to find me entertaining i thought they were interested in my mission and interest was what i wanted to arouse i didnt know how influential these people might bethey talked as if they had great authority i had brought along in my telescope bag some good pieces of potterynot the best i was afraid of accident but some that were representativeand all the photographs blake and i had taken we had only a small kodak and these pictures didnt make much showlooked indeed like grubby little dobe ruins such as one can find almost anywhere they gave no idea of the beauty and vastness of the setting the clerks at the indian commission seemed very curious about everything and made me talk a lot i was green and didnt know any better but when one of the fellows there tried to get me to give him my best bowl for his cigarette ashes i began to suspect the nature of their interest at last the commissioner returned but he had pressing engagements and i hung around several days more before he would see me after questioning me for about half an hour he told me that his business was with living indians not dead ones and that his office should have informed me of that in the beginning he advised me to go back to our congressman and get a letter to the smithsonian institution i packed up my pottery and got out of the place feeling pretty sore the head clerk followed me down the corridor and asked me what id take for that little bowl hed taken a fancy to he said it had no market value id find washington full of such things there were cases of them in the cellar at the smithsonian that theyd never taken the trouble to unpack hadnt any place to put them i went back to my congressman this time he wasnt so friendly as before but he gave me a letter to the smithsonian there i went through the same experience the director couldnt be seen except by appointment and his secretary had to be convinced that your business was important before he would give you an appointment with his chief after the first morning i found it difficult to see even the secretary he was always engaged i was told to take a seat and wait but when he was disengaged he was hurrying off to luncheon i would sit there all morning with a group of unfortunate people girls who wanted to get typewriting to do nice polite old men who wanted to be taken out on surveys and expeditions next summer the secretary would at last come out with his overcoat on and would hurry through the waitingroom reading a letter or a report without looking up the office assistants cheered me along and i kept this up for some days sitting all morning in that room studying the patterns of the rugs and the shoes of the patient waiters who came as regularly as i one day after the secretary had gone out his stenographer a nice little virginia girl came and sat down in an empty chair next to mine and began talking to me she wasnt pretty but her kind eyes and soft southern voice took hold of me at once she wanted to know what i had in my telescope and why i was there and where i came from and all about it nearly everyone else had gone out to lunchthat seemed to be the one thing they did regularly in washingtonand we had the waitingroom to ourselves i talked to her a good deal her name was virginia ward she was a tiny little thing but she had lovely eyes and such gentle ways she seemed indignant that i had been put off so long after having come so far now you just let me fix it up for you she said at last mr wagner is bothered by a great many foolish people who waste his time and he is suspicious the best way will be for you to invite him to lunch with you ill arrange it i keep a list of his appointments and i know he is not engaged for luncheon tomorrow ill tell him that he is to lunch with a nice boy who has come all the way from new mexico to inform the department about an important discovery ill tell him to meet you at the shoreham at one thats expensive but it would do no good to invite him to a cheap place and remember you must ask him to order the luncheon it will maybe cost you ten dollars but it will get you somewhere i felt grateful to the nice little thingshe wasnt older than i i begged her wouldnt she please come to lunch with me herself today and talk to me oh no she said blushing red as a poppy why im afraid you think i told her i didnt think anything but how nice she was to me and how lonesome i was she went with me but she wouldnt go to any swell place she told me a great many useful things if you want to get attention from anybody in washinton she said ask them to lunch people here will do almost anything for a good lunch but the director of the smithsonian for instance i said surely you dont mean that the highup ones like that why would he want to bother with a cowpuncher from new mexico when he can lunch with scientists and ambassadors she had a pretty little fluttery southern laugh you just name a hotel like the shoreham to the director and try it there has to be somebody to pay for a lunch and the scientists and ambassadors dont do that when they can avoid it hed accept your invitation and the next time he went to dine with the secretary of state hed make a nice little story of it and paint you up so pretty youd hardly know yourself when i asked her whether id better take my potteryit was there under the table between usto the shoreham to show mr wagner she tittered again i wouldnt bother if you show him enough of the shoreham pottery that will be more effective the next morning when the secretary arrived at his office he stopped by my chair and said he understood he had an engagement with me for one oclock that was a good idea he added his mind was freer when he was away from office routine i had been in washington twentytwo days when i took the secretary out to lunch it was an excellent lunch we had a bottle of chacircteau dyquem id never heard of such a wine before but i remember it because it cost five dollars i drank only one glass and that pleased him too for he drank the rest though he was friendly and talked a great deal my heart sank lower for he wouldnt let me explain my mission to him at all he kept telling me that he knew all about the southwest he had been sent by the smithsonian to conduct parties of european archaeologists through all the show places frijoles and canyon de chelly and taos and the hopi pueblos when some austrian archduke had gone to hunt in the pecos range he had been sent by his chief and the german ambassador to manage the tour and he had done it with such success that both he and the director were given decorations from the austrian crown in recognition of his services then i had to listen to a long story about how well he was treated by the archduke when he went to vienna with his chief the following summer i had to hear about the balls and receptions and the names and titles of all the people he had met at the dukes country estate i was amazed and ashamed that a man of fifty a man of the world a scholar with ever so many degrees should find it worth his while to show off before a boy and a boy of such humble pretensions who didnt know how to eat the hors doevres any more than if an assortment of cocoanuts had been set before him with no hammer imagine my astonishment when as he was drinking his liqueur he said carelessly by the way i was successful in arranging an interview with the director for you he will see you at four oclock on monday that was thursday i spent the time between then and monday trying to find out something more about the kind of people i had come among i persuaded virginia ward to go to the theatre with me and she told me that it always took a long while to get anything through with the director that i mustnt lose heart and she would always be glad to cheer me up she lived with her mother a widow lady and they had me come to dinner and were very nice to me all this time i was living with a young married couple who interested me very much for they were unlike any people i had ever known the husband was in office as they say there he had some position in the war department how it did use to depress me to see all the hundreds of clerks come pouring out of that big building at sunset their lives seemed to me so petty so slavish the couple i lived with gave me a prejudice against that kind of life i couldnt help knowing a good deal about their affairs they had only a small rented flat and rented me one room of it so i was very much in their confidence and couldnt help overhearing they asked me not to mention the fact that i paid rent as they had told their friends i was making them a visit it was like that in everything they spent their lives trying to keep up appearances and to make his salary do more than it could when they werent discussing where she should go in the summer they talked about the promotions in his department how much the other clerks got and how they spent it how many new dresses their wives had and there was always a struggle going on for an invitation to a dinner or a reception or even a teaparty when once they got the invitation they had been scheming for then came the terrible question of what mrs bixby should wear the secretary of war gave a reception there was to be dancing and a great showing of foreign uniforms the bixbys were in painful suspense until they got a card then for a week they talked about nothing but what mrs bixby was going to wear they decided that for such an occasion she must have a new dress bixby borrowed twentyfive dollars from me and took his lunch hour to go shopping with his wife and choose the satin that seemed to me very strange in new mexico the indian boys sometime went to traders with their wives and bought shawls or calico and we thought it rather contemptible on the night of the reception the bixbys set off gaily in a cab the dress they considered a great success but they had bad luck somebody spilt claretcup on mrs bixbys skirt before the evening was half over and when they got home that night i heard her weeping and reproaching him for having been so upset about it and looking at nothing but her ruined dress all evening she said he cried out when it happened i dont doubt it every cab every party was more than they could afford if he lost an umbrella it was a real misfortune he wasnt lazy he wasnt a fool and he meant to be honest but he was intimidated by that miserable sort of departmental life he didnt know anything else he thought working in a store or a bank not respectable living with the bixbys gave me a kind of lowspiritedness i had never known before during my days of waiting for appointments i used to walk for hours around the fence that shuts in the white house grounds and watch the washington monument colour with those beautiful sunsets until the time when all the clerks streamed out of the treasury building and the war and navy thousands of them all more or less like the couple i lived with they seemed to me like people in slavery who ought to be free i remember the city chiefly by those beautiful hazy sad sunsets white columns and green shrubbery and the monument shaft still pink while the stars were coming out i got my interview with the director of the smithsonian at last he gave me his attention he was interested he told me to come again in three days and meet dr ripley who was the authority on prehistoric indian remains and had excavated a lot of them then came an exciting and rather encouraging time for me dr ripley asked the right sort of questions and evidently knew his business he said hed like to take the first train down to my mesa but it required money to excavate and he had none there was a bill up before congress for an appropriation wed have to wait i must use my influence with my representative he took my pottery to study it i never got it back by the way there was a dr fox connected with the smithsonian who was also interested they told me a good many things i wanted to know and kept me dangling about the office of course they were very kind to take so much trouble with a green boy but i soon found that the director and all his staff had one interest which dwarfed every other there was to be an international exposition of some sort in europe the following summer and they were all pulling strings to get appointed on juries or sent to international congressesappointments that would pay their expenses abroad and give them a salary in addition there was indeed a bill before congress for appropriations for the smithsonian but there was also a bill for exposition appropriations and that was the one they were really pushing they kept me hanging on through march and april but in the end it came to nothing dr ripley told me he was sorry but the sum congress had allowed the smithsonian wouldnt cover an expedition to the southwest virginia ward who had been so kind to me went out to lunch with me that day and admitted i had been let down she was almost as much disappointed as i she said the only thing dr ripley really cared about was getting a free trip to europe and acting on a jury and maybe getting a decoration and thats what the director wants too she said they dont care much about dead and gone indians what they do care about is going to paris and getting another ribbon on their coats the only other person besides virginia who was genuinely concerned about my affair was a young frenchman a lieutenant attached to the french embassy who came to the smithsonian often on business connected with this same international exposition he was nice and polite to virginia and she introduced him to me we used to walk down along the potomac together he studied my photographs and asked me such intelligent questions about everything that it was a pleasure to talk to him he had a fine attitude about it all he was thoughtful critical and respectful i feel sure hed have gone back to new mexico with me if hed had the money he was even poorer than i i was utterly ashamed to go home to roddy dead broke after all the money id spent and without a thing to show for it i hung on in washington through may trying to get a job of some sort to at least earn my fare home my letters to blake had been pretty blue for some time back if id been sensible id have kept my troubles to myself he was easily discouraged and i knew that at last i had to write him for money to go home it was slow in coming and i began to telegraph i left washington at last wiser than i came i had no plans i wanted nothing but to get back to the mesa and live a free life and breathe free air and never never again to see hundreds of little blackcoated men pouring out of white buildings queer how much more depressing they are than workmen coming out of a factory i was terribly disappointed when i got off the train at tarpin and roddy wasnt at the station to meet me it was late in the afternoon almost dark and i went straight to the livery stable to ask bill hook for news of blake hook you remember had done all our hauling for us and had been a good friend he gave me a glad hand and said blake was out on the mesa i expect maybe hes had his feelings hurt here hes been shy of this town lately you see tom folks werent bothered none about that mesa so long as you fellows were playing robinson crusoe out there digging up curios but when it leaked out that blake had got a lot of money for your stuff then they begun to feel jealoussaid them ruins didnt belong to blake any more than anybody else itll blow over in time people are always like that when money changes hands but right now theres a good deal of bad feeling i told him i didnt know what he was talking about you mean you aint heard about the german fechtig well rodneys got some surprise waiting for you why hes had the damnedest luck hes cleaned up a neat little pile on your stuff i begged him to tell me what stuff he meant why your curios this german fechtig come along hed been buying up a lot of indian things out here and he bought your whole outfit and paid four thousand dollars down for it the transaction made quite a stir here in tarpin im not kicking i made a good thing out of it my mules were busy three weeks packing the stuff out of there on their backs and i held the dutchman up for a fancy price he had packing cases made at the wagon shop and took em up to the mesa full of straw and sawdust and packed the curios out there i lost one of my mules too you remember jenny well they were leading her down with a big box on her and right there where the trail runs so narrow around a bump in the cliff above black canyon she lost her balance and fell clean to the bottom her load on her pretty near a thousand feet i guess we never went down to hold a postmortem but fechtig paid for her like a gentleman i remember i sat down on the sofa in hooks office because i couldnt stand up any longer and the smell of the horse blankets began to make me deathly sick in a minute i went over like a girl in a novel hook pulled me out on the sidewalk and gave me some whisky out of his pocket flask when i felt better i asked him how long this german had been gone and what he had done with the things oh he cleared out three weeks ago he didnt waste no time he treated everybody well though nobodys sore at him its your partner theyre turned against fechtig took the stuff right along with him chartered a freight car and travelled in the car with it i reckon its on the water by now he took it straight through into old mexico and was to load it on a french boat seems he was afraid of having trouble getting curiosities out of the united states ports you know you can take anything out of the city of mexico i had heard all i wanted to hear i went to the hotel got a room and lay down without undressing to wait for daylight hook was to drive me and my trunk out to the mesa early the next morning all id been through in washington was nothing to what i went through that night i thought blake must have lost his mind i didnt for a minute believe hed meant to sell me out but i cursed his stupidity and presumption i had never told him just how i felt about those things wed dug out together it was the kind of thing one doesnt talk about directly but he must have known he couldnt have lived with me all summer and fall without knowing and yet until that night i had never known myself that i cared more about them than about anything else in the world at the first blink of daylight i jumped up from my damnable bed and went round to the stable to rout hook out of his bunk we had breakfast and got out of town with his best team on the way to the mesa we had a breakdown one of the old dry wheels smashed to splinters hook had to unhitch and ride back to tarpin and get another everything took an unreasonably long time and the afternoon was half gone when he put me and my trunk down at the foot of the black canyon trail every inch of that trail was dear to me every delicate curve about the old pintildeon roots every chancy track along the face of the cliffs and the deep windings back into shrubbery and safety the wildcurrant bushes were in bloom and where the path climbed the side of a narrow ravine the scent of them in the sun was so heavy that it made me soft made me want to lie down and sleep i wanted to see and touch everything like homesick children when they come home when i pulled out on top of the mesa the rays of sunlight fell slantingly through the little twisted pintildeonsthe light was all in between them as red as a daylight fire they fairly swam in it once again i had that glorious feeling that ive never had anywhere else the feeling of being on the mesa in a world above the world and the air my god what airsoft tingling gold hot with an edge of chill on it full of the smell of pintildeonsit was like breathing the sun breathing the colour of the sky down there behind me was the plain already streaked with shadow violet and purple and burnt orange until it met the horizon before me was the flat mesa top thinly sprinkled with old cedars that were not much taller than i though their twisted trunks were almost as thick as my body i struck off across it my long black shadow going ahead i made straight for the cabin it was about three miles from the spot where the trail emerged at the top i saw smoke rising before i could see the hut itself blake was in the doorway when i got there i didnt look at his face but i could feel that he looked at mine dont say anything tom dont rip me up until you hear all about it he said as i came toward him ive heard enough to about do for me i blurted out what made you do it blake what made you do it it was a chance in a million boy there wasnt any time to consult you theres only one man in thousands that wants to buy relics and pay real money for them i could see how your washington campaign was coming out i know youd thought about big figures so had i but that was all a pipe dream four thousands not so bad you dont pick it up every day and he bore all the expenses why it was a terrible expensive job getting all that frail stuff out of here who else would have bought it i want to know wed have had to pack it around at harvey houses selling it at a dollar a bowl like the poor indians do i took the best chance going for both of us tom i didnt say anything because there was too much to say i stood outside the cabin until the gold light went blue and a few stars came out hardly brighter than the bright sky they twinkled in and the swallows came flying over us on their way to their nests in the cliffs it was the time of day when everything goes home from habit and from weariness i went in through the door the kitchen table was spread for supper i could smell a rabbit stew cooking on the stove blake lit the lantern and begged me to eat my supper i didnt go into the bunkroom for i knew the shelves in there were empty i heard blake talking to me as you hear people talking when you are asleep who else would have bought them he kept saying folks make a lot of fuss over such things but they dont want to pay good money for them when i at last told him that such a thing as selling them had never entered my head im sure he thought i was lying he reminded me about how we used to talk of getting big money from the government i admitted id hoped wed be paid for our work and maybe get a bonus of some kind for our discovery but i never thought of selling them because they werent mine to sellnor yours they belonged to this country to the state and to all the people they belonged to boys like you and me that have no other ancestors to inherit from youve gone and sold them to a country thats got plenty of relics of its own youve gone and sold your countrys secrets like dreyfus that man was innocent it was a frameup blake murmured it was a point he would never pass up whether hes guilty or not you are if there was only anybody in washington i could telegraph to and have that german held up at the port thats just it if there was anybody in washington that cared a damn i wouldnt have sold em but you pretty well found out there aint we could have kept them then i told him ive got a strong back im not so poor that i have to sell the pots and pans that belonged to my poor grandmothers a thousand years ago i made all my plans on the train coming back it was a lie i hadnt i meant to get a job on the railroad and keep our find right here and come back to it when i had a layoff i think a lot more of it now than before i went to washington and after a while when that exposition is over and the smithsonian people get home they would come out here all right ive learned enough from them so that i could go on with it myself blake reminded me that i had my way to make in the world and that i wanted to go to school that moneys in the bank this minute in your name and youre going to college on it youre not going to be a daylabourer like me after youve got your sheepskin then you can divide with me you think id touch that money i looked squarely at him for the first time no more than if youd stolen it you made the sale get what you can out of it i want to ask you one question did you ever think i was digging those things up for what i could sell them for rodney explained that he knew i cared about the things and was proud of them but hed always supposed i meant to realize on them just as he did and that it would come to money in the end everything does he added if that nice young frenchman i met had come down here with me and offered me four million instead of four thousand id have refused him there never was any question of money with me where this mesa and its people were concerned they were something that had been preserved through the ages by a miracle and handed on to you and me two poor cowpunchers rough and ignorant but i thought we were men enough to keep a trust id as soon have sold my own grandmother as mother eveid have sold any living woman first save your tears said roddy grimly she refused to leave us she went to the bottom of black canyon and carried hooks best mule along with her they had to make her box extra wide and she crowded out an inch or so too far from the canyon wall this painful interview went on for hours i walked up and down the kitchen trying to make blake understand the kind of value those objects had had for me unfortunately i succeeded he sat slumping on the bench his elbows on the table shading his eyes from the lantern with his hands theres no need to keep this up he said at last youre away out of my depth but i think i get you you might have given me some of this fourth of july talk a little earlier in the game i didnt know you valued that stuff any different than anything else a fellow might run on to a gold mine or a pocket of turquoise i suppose you gave him my diary along with the rest no said blake his voice growing gloomier and darker thats in the eagles nest where you hid it thats your private property i supposed i had some share in the relics we dug upyou always spoke of it that way but i see now i was working for you like a hired man and while you were away i sold your property i said again it wasnt mine or his he took something out of the pocket of his flannel shirt and laid it on the table i saw it was a bank passbook with my name on the yellow cover you may as well keep it i said ill never touch it you had no right to deposit it in my name the townspeople are sore about the money and theyll hold it against me no they wont cant you trust me to fix that i dont know what i can trust you with blake i dont know where im at with you i said he got up and began putting on his coat motives dont count eh he said his face turned away as he put his arm into the sleeve they would in anything of our own between you and me i told him if it was my money youd lost gambling or my girl youd made free with we could fight it out and maybe be friends again but this is different i see you make it clear he was quietly stirring around as he spoke he got his old knapsack off its nail on the wall opened his trunk and took out some underwear and socks and a couple of shirts after he had put these into the bag he slung it over one shoulder and his canvas waterbag over the other i let these preparations go on without a word he went to the cupboard over the stove and put some sticks of chocolate into his pocket then his pipe and a bag of tobacco presently i said hed break his neck if he tried riding down the trail in the dark im not riding the trail he replied curtly im going down the quick way my horse is grazing in cow canyon i noticed the rivers high its dangerous crossing i remarked i got over that way a few days ago im surprised at you using such common expressions he said sarcastically dangerous crossing its painted on signboards all over the world he walked out of the cabin without looking back i followed him to the vshaped break in the rim rock hardly larger than a mans body where the spliced treetrunks made a swinging ladder down the face of the cliff i wanted to protest but only succeeded in finding fault youll catch your knapsack on those forks and come to grief thats my lookout by this time my eyes had grown accustomed to the darkness and i could see blake quite clearlythe stubborn crouching set of his shoulders that i used to notice when he first came to pardee and was drinking all the time there was an ache in my arms to reach out and detain him but there was something else that made me absolutely powerless to do so he stepped down and settled his foot into the first fork then he stopped a moment and straightened his pack buttoned his coat up to the chin and pulled his hat on tighter there was always a night draught in the canyon he gripped the trunk with his hands well he said with grim cheerfulness heres luck and im glad its you thats doing this to me tom not me thats doing it to you his head disappeared below the rim i could hear the trees creak under his heavy body and the chains rattle a little at the splicings i lay down on the ledge and listened i could hear him for a long way down and the sounds were comforting to me though i didnt realize it then the silence closed in i went to sleep that night hoping i would never waken     chapter 7   the next morning the whinnying of my saddlehorse in the shed roused me i took him down to the foot of the trail where id left my trunk and packed my things up to the cabin on his back i sat up late that night waiting for blake though i knew he wouldnt come a few days later i rode into tarpin for news of him bill hook showed me roddys horse he had sold him to the barn for sixty dollars the stationmaster told me blake had bought a ticket to winslow arizona i wired the stationmaster and the dispatcher at winslow but they could give me no information father duchene came along on his rounds and i told him the whole story he thought blake would come back sometime that id only miss him if i went out to look for him he advised me to stay on the mesa that summer and get ahead with my studies work up my spanish grammar and my latin he had friends all along the santa feacute and he was sure we could catch blake by advertising in the local papers along the road albuquerque winslow flagstaff williams los angeles after a few days with him i went back to the mesa to wait ill never forget the night i got back i crossed the river an hour before sunset and hobbled my horse in the wide bottom of cow canyon the moon was up though the sun hadnt set and it had that glittering silveriness the early stars have in high altitudes the heavenly bodies look so much more remote from the bottom of a deep canyon than they do from the level the climb of the walls helps out the eye somehow i lay down on a solitary rock that was like an island in the bottom of the valley and looked up the grey sagebrush and the bluegrey rock around me were already in shadow but high above me the canyon walls were dyed flamecolour with the sunset and the cliff city lay in a gold haze against its dark cavern in a few minutes it too was grey and only the rim rock at the top held the red light when that was gone i could still see the copper glow in the pintildeons along the edge of the top ledges the arc of sky over the canyon was silvery blue with its pale yellow moon and presently stars shivered into it like crystals dropped into perfectly clear water i remember these things because in a sense that was the first night i was ever really on the mesa at allthe first night that all of me was there this was the first time i ever saw it as a whole it all came together in my understanding as a series of experiments do when you begin to see where they are leading something had happened in me that made it possible for me to coordinate and simplify and that process going on in my mind brought with it great happiness it was possession the excitement of my first discovery was a very pale feeling compared to this one for me the mesa was no longer an adventure but a religious emotion i had read of filial piety in the latin poets and i knew that was what i felt for this place it had formerly been mixed up with other motives but now that they were gone i had my happiness unalloyed what that night began lasted all summer i stayed on the mesa until november it was the first time id ever studied methodically or intelligently i got the better of the spanish grammar and read the twelve books of the aeligneid i studied in the morning and in the afternoon i worked at clearing away the mess the german had made in packingtidying up the ruins to wait another hundred years maybe for the right explorer i can scarcely hope that life will give me another summer like that one it was my high tide every morning when the suns rays first hit the mesa top while the rest of the world was in shadow i wakened with the feeling that i had found everything instead of having lost everything nothing tired me up there alone a close neighbour to the sun i seemed to get the solar energy in some direct way and at night when i watched it drop down behind the edge of the plain below me i used to feel that i couldnt have borne another hour of that consuming light that i was full to the brim and needed dark and sleep all that summer i never went up to the eagles nest to get my diaryindeed its probably there yet i didnt feel the need of that record it would have been going backward i didnt want to go back and unravel things step by step perhaps i was afraid that i would lose the whole in the parts at any rate i didnt go for my record during those months i didnt worry much about poor roddy i told myself the advertisements would surely get himi knew his habit of reading newspapers there are times when ones vitality is too high to be clouded too elastic to stay down hurrying in from my cabin in the morning to the spot in the cliff city where i studied under a cedar i used to be frightened at my own heartlessness but the feel of the narrow moccasinworn trail in the flat rock made my feet glad like a good taste in the mouth and id forget all about blake without knowing it i found i was reading too fast so i began to commit long passages of vergil to memoryif it hadnt been for that i might have forgotten how to use my voice or gone to talking to myself when i look into the aeligneid now i can always see two pictures the one on the page and another behind that blue and purple rocks and yellowgreen pintildeons with flat tops little clustered houses clinging together for protection a rude tower rising in their midst rising strong with calmness and couragebehind it a dark grotto in its depths a crystal spring happiness is something one cant explain you must take my word for it troubles enough came afterward but there was that summer high and blue a life in itself next winter i went back to pardee and stayed with the obriens again working on the section and studying with father duchene and trying to get some word of blake now that i was back on the railroad i thought i couldnt fail to find him i went out to winslow and to williams and i questioned the railroad men we advertised for him in every possible way had all the santa feacute operatives and the police and the catholic missionaries on the watch for him offered a thousand dollars reward for whoever found him but it came to nothing father duchene and our friends down there are still looking but the older i grow the more i understand what it was i did that night on the mesa anyone who requites faith and friendship as i did will have to pay for it im not very sanguine about good fortune myself ill be called to account when i least expect it in the spring just a year after i quarrelled with roddy i landed here and walked into your garden and the rest you know       the professor     chapter 1   all the most important things in his life st peter sometimes reflected had been determined by chance his education in france had been an accident his married life had been happy largely through a circumstance with which neither he nor his wife had anything to do they had been young people with good qualities and very much in love but they could not have been happy if lillian had not inherited a small income from her fatheronly about sixteen hundred a year but it had made all the difference in the world a few memorable interregnums between servants had let him know that lillian couldnt pinch and be shabby and do housework as the wives of some of his colleagues did under such conditions she became another person and a bitter one tom outland had been a stroke of chance he couldnt possibly have imagined his strange coming his strange story his devotion his early death and posthumous fameit was all fantastic fantastic too that this tramp boy should amass a fortune for someone whose name he had never heard for an extravagant and wheeling stranger the professor often thought of that curiously bitter burst from the barytone in brahms requiem attending the words he heapeth up riches and cannot tell who shall scatter them the vehemence of this passage had seemed to him uncalled for until he read it by the light of the history of his own family st peter thought he had fared well with fate he wouldnt choose to live his life overhe might not have such good luck again he had had two romances one of the heart which had filled his life for many years and a second of the mindof the imagination just when the morning brightness of the world was wearing off for him along came outland and brought him a kind of second youth through outlands studies long after they had ceased to be pupil and master he had been able to experience afresh things that had grown dull with use the boys mind had the superabundance of heat which is always present where there is rich germination to share his thoughts was to see old perspectives transformed by new effects of light if the last four volumes of the spanish adventurers were more simple and inevitable than those that went before it was largely because of outland when st peter first began his work he realized that his great drawback was the lack of early association the fact that he had not spent his youth in the great dazzling southwest country which was the scene of his explorers adventures by the time he had got as far as the third volume into his house walked a boy who had grown up there a boy with imagination with the training and insight resulting from a very curious experience who had in his pocket the secrets which old trails and stones and watercourses tell only to adolescence two years after toms graduation they took the copy of fray garces manuscript that the professor had made from the original in spain and went down into the southwest together by autumn they had been over every mile of his trail on horseback tom could take a sentence from garces diary and find the exact spot at which the missionary crossed the rio colorado on a certain sunday in 1775 given one pueblo he could always find the route by which the priest had reached the next it was on that trip that they went to toms blue mesa climbed the ladder of spliced pinetrees to the cliff city and up to the eagles nest there they took toms diary from the stone cupboard where he had sealed it up years ago before he set out for washington on his fruitless errand the next summer tom went with the professor to old mexico they had planned a third summer together in paris but it never came off outland was delayed by the formalities of securing his patent and then came august 1914 father duchene the missionary priest who had been toms teacher stopped in hamilton on his way back to belgium hurrying home to serve in any capacity he might the rugged old man stayed in hamilton only four days but in that time outland made up his mind had a will drawn packed and said goodbye he sailed with father duchene on the rochambeau to this day st peter regretted that he had never got that vacation in paris with tom outland he had wanted to revisit certain spots with him to go with him some autumn morning to the luxembourg gardens when the yellow horsechestnuts were bright and bitter after the rain to stand with him before the monument to delacroix and watch the sun gleam on the bronze figurestime bearing away the youth who was struggling to snatch his palmor was it to lay a palm not that it mattered it might have mattered to tom had not chance in one great catastrophe swept away all youth and all palms and almost time itself     and suppose tom had been more prudent and had not gone away with his old teacher st peter sometimes wondered what would have happened to him once the trap of worldly success had been sprung on him he couldnt see tom building outland or becoming a publicspirited citizen of hamilton what change would have come in his blue eye in his fine long hand with the backspringing thumb which had never handled things that were not the symbols of ideas a hand like that had he lived must have been put to other uses his fellow scientists his wife the town and state would have required many duties of it it would have had to write thousands of useless letters frame thousands of false excuses it would have had to manage a great deal of money to be the instrument of a woman who would grow always more exacting he had escaped all that he had made something new in the worldand the rewards the meaningless conventional gestures he had left to others     chapter 2   all those summer days while the professor was sending cheerful accounts of his activities to his family in france he was really doing very little he had begun in a desultory way to annotate the diary that tom had kept on the mesa in which he had noted down the details of each days work among the ruins along with the weather and anything unusual in the routine of their life there was a minute description of each tool they found of every piece of cloth and pottery frequently accompanied by a very suggestive pencil sketch of the object and a surmise as to its use and the kind of life in which it had played a part to st peter this plain account was almost beautiful because of the stupidities it avoided and the things it did not say if words had cost money tom couldnt have used them more sparingly the adjectives were purely descriptive relating to form and colour and were used to present the objects under consideration not the young explorers emotions yet through this austerity one felt the kindling imagination the ardour and excitement of the boy like the vibration in a voice when the speaker strives to conceal his emotion by using only conventional phrases when the first of august came round the professor realized that he had pleasantly trifled away nearly two months at a task which should have taken little more than a week but he had been doing a good deal besidessomething he had never before been able to do st peter had always laughed at people who talked about daydreams just as he laughed at people who naively confessed that they had an imagination all his life his mind had behaved in a positive fashion when he was not at work or being actively amused he went to sleep he had no twilight stage but now he enjoyed this halfawake loafing with his brain as if it were a new sense arriving late like wisdom teeth he found he could lie on his sandspit by the lake for hours and watch the seven motionless pines drink up the sun in the evening after dinner he could sit idle and watch the stars with the same immobility he was cultivating a novel mental dissipationand enjoying a new friendship tom outland had not come back again through the garden door as he had so often done in dreams but another boy had the boy the professor had long ago left behind him in kansas in the solomon valleythe original unmodified godfrey st peter this boy and he had meant back in those faraway days to live some sort of life together and to share good and bad fortune they had not shared together for the reason that they were unevenly matched the young st peter who went to france to try his luck had a more active mind than the twin he left behind in the solomon valley after his adoption into the thierault household he remembered that other boy very rarely in moments of homesickness after he met lillian ornsley st peter forgot that boy had ever lived but now that the vivid consciousness of an earlier state had come back to him the professor felt that life with this kansas boy little as there had been of it was the realest of his lives and that all the years between had been accidental and ordered from the outside his career his wife his family were not his life at all but a chain of events which had happened to him all these things had nothing to do with the person he was in the beginning the man he was now the personality his friends knew had begun to grow strong during adolescence during the years when he was always consciously or unconsciously conjugating the verb to lovein society and solitude with people with books with the sky and open country in the lonesomeness of crowded city streets when he met lillian it reached its maturity from that time to this existence had been a catching at handholds one thing led to another and one development brought on another and the design of his life had been the work of this secondary social man the lover it had been shaped by all the penalties and responsibilities of being and having been a lover because there was lillian there must be marriage and a salary because there was marriage there were children because there were children and fervour in the blood and brain books were born as well as daughters his histories he was convinced had no more to do with his original ego than his daughters had they were a result of the high pressure of young manhood the kansas boy who had come back to st peter this summer was not a scholar he was a primitive he was only interested in earth and woods and water wherever sun sunned and rain rained and snow snowed wherever life sprouted and decayed places were alike to him he was not nearly so cultivated as toms old cliffdwellers must have beenand yet he was terribly wise he seemed to be at the root of the matter desire under all desires truth under all truths he seemed to know among other things that he was solitary and must always be so he had never married never been a father he was earth and would return to earth when white clouds blew over the lake like bellying sails when the seven pinetrees turned red in the declining sum he felt satisfaction and said to himself merely that is right coming upon a curly root that thrust itself across his path he said that is it when the mapleleaves along the street began to turn yellow and waxy and were soft to the touchlike the skin on old faceshe said that is true it is time all these recognitions gave him a kind of sad pleasure when he was not dumbly deeply recognizing he was bringing up out of himself longforgotten unimportant memories of his early childhood of his mother his father his grandfather his grandfather old napoleon godfrey used to go about lost in profound continuous meditation sometimes chuckling to himself occasionally at the family dinnertable the old man would try to rouse himself from motives of politeness and would ask some kindly questionnearly always absurd and often the same one he had asked yesterday the boys used to shout with laughter and wonder what profound matters could require such deep meditation and make a man speak so foolishly about what was going on under his very eyes st peter thought he was beginning to understand what the old man had been thinking about though he himself was but fiftytwo and napoleon had been well on in his eighties there are only a few years at the last in which man can consider his estate and he thought he might be quite as near the end of his road as his grandfather had been in those days the professor knew of course that adolescence grafted a new creature into the original one and that the complexion of a mans life was largely determined by how well or ill his original self and his nature as modified by sex rubbed on together what he had not known was that at a given time that first nature could return to a man unchanged by all the pursuits and passions and experiences of his life untouched even by the tastes and intellectual activities which have been strong enough to give him distinction among his fellows and to have made for him as they say a name in the world perhaps this reversion did not often occur but he knew it had happened to him and he suspected it had happened to his grandfather he did not regret his life but he was indifferent to it it seemed to him like the life of another person along with other states of mind which attended his realization of the boy godfrey came a conviction he did not see it coming it was there before he was aware of its approach that he was nearing the end of his life this conviction took its place so quietly seemed so matteroffact that he gave it little thought but one day when he realized that all the while he was preparing for the fall term he didnt in the least believe he would be alive during the fall term he thought he might better see a doctor     chapter 3   the family doctor knew all about st peter it was summer moreover and he had plenty of time he devoted several mornings to the professor and made tests of the most searching kind in the end he of course told st peter there was nothing the matter with him what made you come to me any discomfort or pain none i simply feel tired all the time dr dudley shrugged so do i sleep well almost too much eat well in every sense of the word well i am my own chef always a gourmet and never anything wrong with your digestive tract i wish youd ask me to dine with you some night any of that sherry left a little i use it plentifully ill bet you do but why did you think there was something wrong with you low in your mind no merely low in energy enjoy doing nothing i came to you from a sense of duty how about travel i shrink from the thought of it as i tell you i enjoy doing nothing then do it theres nothing the matter with you follow your inclination st peter went home well satisfied he did not mention to dr dudley the real reason for his asking for a medical examination one doesnt mention such things the feeling that he was near the conclusion of his life was an instinctive conviction such as we have when we waken in the dark and know at once that it is near morning or when we are walking across the country and suddenly know that we are near the sea letters came every week from france lillian and louie alternated so that one or the other got off a letter to him on every fast boat louie told him that wherever they went when they had an especially delightful day they bought him a present at trouville for instance they had laid in dozens of the brilliant rubber casquettes he liked to wear when he went swimming at aixlesbains they found a gorgeous dressinggown for him in a chinese shop st peter was happy in his mind about them all he was glad they were there and that he was here their generous letters written when there were so many pleasant things to do certainly deserved more than one reading he used to carry them out to the lake to read them over again after coming out of the water he would lie on the sand holding them in his hand but somehow never taking his eyes off the pinetrees appliqueacuted against the blue water and their ripe yellow cones dripping with gum and clustering on the pointed tips like a mass of golden bees in swarmingtime usually he carried his letters home unread his family wrote constantly about their plans for next summer when they were going to take him over with them next summer the professor wondered sometimes he thought he would like to drive up in front of notre dame in paris again and see it standing there like the rock of ages with the frail generation breaking about its base he hadnt seen it since the war but if he went anywhere next summer he thought it would be down into outlands country to watch the sunrise break on sculptured peaks and impassable mountain passesto look off at those long rugged untamed vistas dear to the american heart dear to all hearts probablyat least calling to all else why had his grandfathers grandfather who had tramped so many miles across europe into russia with the grande armeacutee come out to the canadian wilderness to forget the chagrin of his emperors defeat     chapter 4   the fall term of the university opened and now the professor went to his lectures instead of to the lake he supposed he did his work he heard no complaints from his assistants and the students seemed interested he found however that he wasnt willing to take the trouble to learn the names of several hundred new students it wasnt worth while he felt that his relations with them would be of short duration the mcgregors got home from their vacation in oregon and scott was much amused to find the professor so doggedly anchored in the old house it never struck me doctor that you were a man who would be keeping up two establishments theyll be coming home pretty soon and then youll have to decide where you are going to live i cant leave my study scott thats flat dont then darn it youve a right to two houses if you want em this encounter took place on the street in front of the house the professor went wearily upstairs and lay down on the couch his refuge from this everincreasing fatigue he really didnt see what he was going to do about the matter of domicile he couldnt make himself believe that he was ever going to live in the new house again he didnt belong there he remembered some lines of a translation from the norse he used to read long ago in one of his mothers few books a little twovolume ticknor and fields edition of longfellow in blue and gold that used to lie on the parlour table   for thee a house was built ere thou was born for thee a mould was made ere thou of woman camest   lying on his old couch he could almost believe himself in that house already the sagging springs were like the sham upholstery that is put in coffins just the equivocal american way of dealing with serious facts he reflected why pretend that it is possible to soften that last hard bed he could remember a time when the loneliness of death had terrified him when the idea of it was insupportable he used to feel that if his wife could but lie in the same coffin with him his body would not be so insensible that the nearness of hers would not give it comfort but now he thought of eternal solitude with gratefulness as a release from every obligation from every form of effort it was the truth one morning just as st peter was leaving the house to go to his classroom the postman handed him two letters one addressed in lillians hand and one in louies he put them into his pocket the feel of them disturbed him they were of a suspicious thinnessas if they didnt contain amusing gossip but announced sudden decisions he set off down the street sniffing the lakecooled morning air and trying to overcome a feeling of nervous dread all the morning those two letters lay in his breast pocket though they were so light their effect was to make him drop his shoulders and look woefully tired the weather too had changed come on suddenly hot and sultry at noon as if getting ready for a storm when his classes were over and he was back in his study again st peter felt no interest in lunch he took out the two letters and ripped them open with his forefinger to have it over yes all plans were changed and by the happiest of expectations the family were hurrying home to prepare for the advent of a young marsellus they would sail on the sixteenth on the berengaria lillian added a postscript to the effect that by this same mail she was getting off a letter to augusta who would come to him for the keys of the new house she would be the best person to open the house and arrange to have the cleaning done she would take it entirely off his shoulders and see that everything was properly put in order they were sailing on the sixteenth and this was the seventeenth they were already on the water the berengaria was a fiveday boat st peter caught up his hat and light overcoat and started down the stairs halfway down he stopped short went back to his study and softly shut the door behind him he sat down forgetting to take off his overcoat though the afternoon was so hot and his face was damp with perspiration he sat motionless breathing unevenly one dark hand lying clenched on his writingtable there must he was repeating to himself there must be some way in which a man who had always tried to live up to his responsibilities could when the hour of desperation came avoid meeting his own family he loved his family he would make any sacrifice for them but just now he couldnt live with them he must be alone that was more necessary even than his marriage had been in his vehement youth he could not live with his family againnot even with lillian especially not with lillian her nature was intense and positive it was like a chiselled surface a die a stamp upon which he could not be beaten out any longer if her character were reduced to an heraldic device it would be a hand a beautiful hand holding flaming arrowsthe shafts of her violent loves and hates her clearcut ambitions in great misfortunes he told himself people want to be alone they have a right to be and the misfortunes that occur within one are the greatest surely the saddest thing in the world is falling out of loveif once one has ever fallen in falling out for him seemed to mean falling out of all domestic and social relations out of his place in the human family indeed st peter did not go out of the house that afternoon he did not leave his study he sat at his desk with bent head reviewing his life trying to see where he had made his mistake to account for the fact that he now wanted to run away from everything he had intensely cared for late in the afternoon the heaviness of the air in the room drove him to the window he saw that a storm was coming on great orange and purple clouds were blowing up from the lake and the pinetrees over about the physics laboratory were blacker than cypresses and looked contracted as if they were awaiting something the rain broke and it turned cold the rainstorm was over in half and hour but a heavy blow had set in for the night the wind would be a protection he thought even augusta would hardly come plodding up the stairs tonight it seemed strange to be dreading augusta but just now he did dread her he believed he was safe for tonight though it was only five oclock the sky was black and the room was dusky and chilly he lit the stove and lay down on the couch the fire made a flickering pattern of light on the wall he lay watching it vacantly without meaning to he fell asleep for a long while he slept deeply and peacefully then the wind increasing in violence disturbed him he began to be aware of noisesthings banging and slamming about he turned over on his back and slept deeper still     when st peter at last awoke the room was pitchblack and full of gas he was cold and numb felt sick and rather dazed the longanticipated coincidence had happened he realized the storm had blown the stove out and the window shut the thing to do was to get up and open the window but suppose he did not get up how far was a man required to exert himself against accident how would such a case be decided under english law he hadnt lifted his hand against himselfwas he required to lift it for himself     chapter 5   at midnight st peter was lying in his study on his boxcouch covered up with blankets a hot water bottle at his feet he knew it was midnight for the clock of augustas church across the park was ringing the hour augusta herself was there in the room sitting in her old sewingchair by the kerosene lamp wrapped up in a shawl she was reading a little muchworn religious book that she always carried in her handbag presently he spoke to her just when did you come in augusta she got up and came over to him are you feeling comfortable doctor st peter oh very thank you when did you happen in not any too soon sir she said gravely with a touch of reproof you never would take my cautions about that old stove and it very nearly asphyxiated you i was barely in time to pull you out you pulled me out literally where to into the hall i came over in the storm to ask you for the keys of the new housei didnt get mrs st peters letter until i got home from work this evening and i came right over when i opened the front door i smelled gas and i knew that stove had been up to its old tricks i supposed youd gone out and forgot to turn it off when i got to the second floor i heard a fall overhead and it flashed across me that you were up here and had been overcome i ran up and opened the two windows at the head of the stairs and dragged you out into the wind you were lying on the floor she lowered her voice it was perfectly frightful in here i seem to remember dudleys being here yes after id turned off the stove and opened everything up i went next door and telephoned for doctor dudley i thought id better not say what the trouble was but i asked him to come at once as youd been taken ill you soon came round but you were flighty augusta hurried over her recital she was evidently embarrassed by the behaviour of the stove and the condition in which she had found him it was an ugly accident and she didnt want the neighbours to know of it you must have great presence of mind augusta and a strong arm as well you say you found me on the floor i thought i was lying here on the couch i remember waking up and smelling gas you were stupefied but you must have got up and tried to get to the door before you were overcome i was on the second floor when i heard you fall id never heard anyone fall before that i can remember but i seemed to know just what it was im sorry to have given you a fright i hope the gas hasnt made your head ache alls well that ends well as they say but i doubt if you ought to be talking sir could you go to sleep again i can stay till morning if you prefer id be greatly obliged if you would stay the night with me augusta it would be a comfort i seem to feel rather lonelyfor the first time in months thats because your family are coming home very well sir you do a good deal of this sort of thingwatching and sitting up with people dont you well when i happen to be sewing in a house where theres sickness i am sometimes called upon augusta sat down by the table and again took up little religious book st peter with halfclosed eyes lay watching herregarding in her humankind as if after a definite absence from the world of men and women if he had thought of augusta sooner he would have got up from the couch sooner her image would have at once suggested the proper action augusta he reflected had always been a corrective a remedial influence when she sewed for them she breakfasted at the housethat was part of the arrangement she came early often directly from church and had her breakfast with the professor before the rest of the family were up very often she gave him some wise observation or discreet comment to begin the day with she wasnt at all afraid to say things that were heavily drearily true and though he used to wince under them he hurried off with the feeling that they were good for him that he didnt have to hear such sayings half often enough augusta was like the taste of bitter herbs she was the bloomless side of life that he had always run away fromyet when he had to face it he found that it wasnt altogether repugnant sometimes she used to telephone mrs st peter that she would be a day late because there had been a death in the family where she was sewing just then and she was needed when she met him at the table the next morning she would look just a little more grave than usual while she ate a generous breakfast she would reply to his polite questions about the illness or funeral with befitting solemnity and then go readily to another topic not holding the dolorous note he used to say that he didnt mind hearing augusta announce these deaths which seemed to happen so frequently along her way because her manner of speaking about it made death seem less uncomfortable she hadnt any of the sentimentality that comes from a fear of dying she talked about death as she spoke of a hard winter or a rainy march or any of the sadnesses of nature it occurred to st peter as he lay warm and relaxed but undesirous of sleep that he would rather have augusta with him just now than anyone he could think of seasoned and sound and on the solid earth she surely was and for all her matteroffactness and hardhandedness kind and loyal he even felt a sense of obligation toward her instinctive escaping definition but real and when you admitted that a thing was real that was enoughnow he didnt on being quite honest with himself feel any obligations toward his family lillian had had the best years of his life nearly thirty and joyful years they had been nothing could ever change that but they were gone his daughters had outgrown any great need of him in certain wayward moods kitty would always come to him but rosamond on that shopping expedition in chicago had shown him how painful the paternal relation could be there was still augusta however a world full of augustas with whom one was outward bound all the afternoon he had sat there at the table where now augusta was reading thinking over his life trying to see where had made his mistake perhaps the mistake was merely in an attitude of mind he had never learned to live without delight and he would have to learn to just as in a prohibition country he supposed he would have to learn to live without sherry theoretically he knew that life is possible may be even pleasant without joy without passionate griefs but it had never occurred to him that he might have to live like that though he had been lowspirited all summer he told the truth when he told dr dudley that he had not been melancholy he had no more thought of suicide than he had thought of embezzling he had always regarded it as a grave social misdemeanourexcept when it occurred in very evil times as a form of protest yet when he was confronted by accidental extinction he had felt no will to resist but had let chance take its way as it had done with him so often he did not remember springing up from the couch though he did remember a crisis a moment of acute agonized strangulation his temporary release from consciousness seemed to have been beneficial he had let something goand it was gone something very precious that he could not consciously have relinquished probably he doubted whether his family would ever realize that he was not the same man they had said goodbye to they would be too happily preoccupied with their own affairs if his apathy hurt them they could not possibly be so much hurt as he had been already at least he felt the ground under his feet he thought he knew where he was and that he could face with fortitude the berengaria and the future
