henry colbert the miller always breakfasted with his wifebeyond that he appeared irregularly at the family table at noon the dinner hour he was often detained down at the mill his place was set for him he might come or he might send one of the millhands to bring him a tray from the kitchen the mistress was served promptly she never questioned as to his whereabouts on this morning in march 1856 he walked into the diningroom at eight oclockcame up from the mill where he had been stirring about for two hours or more he wished his wife goodmorning expressed the hope that she had slept well and took his seat in the highbacked armchair opposite her his breakfast was brought in by an old whitehaired coloured man in a striped cotton coat the mistress drew the coffee from a silver coffee urn which stood on four curved legs the china was of good quality as were all the mistresss things surprisingly good to find on the table of a country miller in the virginia backwoods neither the miller nor his wife was native here they had come from a much richer county east of the blue ridge they were a strange couple to be found on back creek though they had lived here now for more than thirty years the miller was a solid powerful figure of a man in whom height and weight agreed his thick black hair was still damp from the washing he had given his face and head before he came up to the house it stood up straight and bushy because he had run his fingers through it his face was full square and distinctly florid a heavy coat of tan made it a reddish brown like an old port he was cleanshavenunusual in a man of his age and station his excuse was that a millers beard got powdered with flourdust and when the sweat ran down his face this flour got wet and left him with a beard full of dough his countenance bespoke a man of upright character straightforward and determined it was only his eyes that were puzzling dark and grave set far back under a square heavy brow those eyes reflective almost dreamy seemed out of keeping with the simple vigour of his face the long lashes would have been a charm in a woman colbert drove his mill hard gave it his life indeed he was noted for fair dealing and was trusted in a community to which he had come a stranger trusted but scarcely liked the people of back creek and timber ridge and hayfield never forgot that he was not one of themselves he was silent and uncommunicative a trait they didnt like and his lack of a southern accent amounted almost to a foreign accent his grandfather had come over from flanders henry was born in loudoun county and had grown up in a neighbourhood of english settlers he spoke the language as they did spoke it clearly and decidedly this was not on back creek a friendly way of talking his wife also spoke differently from the back creek people but they admitted that a woman and an heiress had a right to her mother had come out from englanda fact she never forgot how these two came to be living at the mill farm is a long storytoo long for a breakfasttable story the miller drank his first cup of coffee in silence the old black man stood behind the mistresss chair you may go washington she said presently while she drew another cup of coffee from the urn with her very plump white hands she addressed her husband major grimwood stopped by yesterday on his way to romney you should have come up to see him i couldnt leave the mill just then i had customers who had come a long way with their grain he replied gravely if you had a foreman as everyone else has you would have time to be civil to important visitors and neglect my business yes sapphira i know all about these foremen that is how it is done back in loudoun county the boss tells the foreman and the foreman tells the head nigger and the head nigger passes it on i am the first miller who has ever made a living in these parts a poor one at that we must own said his wife with an indulgent chuckle and speaking of niggers major grimwood tells me his wife is in need of a handy girl just now he knows my servants are well trained and he would like to have one of them he must know you train your servants for your own use we dont sell our people you might ring for some more bacon i seem to feel hungry this morning she rang a little clapper bell washington brought the bacon and again took his place behind his mistresss large cumbersome chair she had been sitting in a muse while he served now without speaking to him she put out her plump hand in the direction of the door the old man scuttled off in his flapping slippers of course we dont sell our people she agreed mildly certainly we would never offer any for sale but to oblige friends is a different matter and youve often said you dont want to stand in anybodys way to live in winchester in a mansion like the grimwoodsany darky would jump at the chance we have none to spare except such as major grimwood wouldnt want i will tell him so mrs colbert went on in her bland considerate voice there is my nancy now i could spare her quite well to oblige mrs grimwood and she could hardly find a better place it would be a fine opportunity for her the miller flushed a deep red up to the roots of his thick hair his eyes seemed to sink farther back under his heavy brow as he looked directly at his wife his look seemed to say i see through all this see to the bottom she did not meet his glance she was gazing thoughtfully at the coffee urn her husband pushed back his plate nancy least of all her mother is here and old jezebel her people have been in your family for four generations you havent trained nancy for mrs grimwood she stays here the icy quality so effective with her servants came into mrs colberts voice as she answered him its nothing to get flustered about henry as you say her mother and grandmother and greatgrandmother were all dodderidge niggers so it seems to me i ought to be allowed to arrange nancys future her mother would approve she knows that a proper ladys maid can never be trained out here in this rough country the millers frown darkened you cant sell her without my name to the deed of sale and i will never put it there you never seemed to understand how when we first moved up here your troop of niggers was held against us this isnt a slaveowning neighbourhood if you sold a good girl like nancy off to winchester people hereabouts would hold it against you they would say hard things mrs colberts small mouth twisted she gave her husband an arch tolerant smile they have talked before and weve survived they surely talked when black till bore a yellow child after two of your brothers had been hanging round here so much some fixed it on jacob and some on guy perhaps you have a kind of family feeling about nancy you know well enough sapphira it was that painter from baltimore perhaps we got the portraits out of him anyway and maybe we got a smart yellow girl into the bargain mrs colbert laughed discreetly as if the idea amused and rather pleased her till was within her rights seeing she had to live with old jeff i never hectored her about it the miller rose and walked toward the door one moment henry as he turned she beckoned him back you dont really mean you will not allow me to dispose of one of my own servants you signed when tom and jake and ginny and the others went back yes because they were going back among their own kin and to the country they were born in but ill never sign for nancy mrs colberts paleblue eyes followed her husband as he went out of the door her small mouth twisted mockingly then we must find some other way she said softly to herself presently she rang for old washington when he came she said nothing being lost in thought but put her hands on the arms of the square highbacked chair in which she sat the old man ran to open two doors then he drew his mistresss chair away from the table picked up a cushion on which her feet had been resting tucked it under his arm and gravely wheeled the chair which proved to be on castors out of the diningroom down the long hall and into mrs colberts bedchamber the mistress had dropsy and was unable to walk she could still stand erect to receive visitors her dresses touched the floor and concealed the deformity of her feet and ankles she was four years older than her husbandand hated it this dropsical affliction was all the more cruel in that she had been a very active woman and had managed the farm as zealously as her husband managed his mill ii at the hour when sapphira dodderidge colbert was leaving the breakfast table in her wheelchair a short stalwart woman in a sunbonnet wearing a heavy shawl over her freshly ironed calico dress was crossing the meadows by a little path which led from the highroad to the mill house she was a woman of thirtysix or seven though she looked olderlooked so much like henry colbert that it was not hard to guess she was his daughter the same set of the head enduring yet determined the broad highly coloured face the fleshy nose anchored deeply at the nostrils she had the millers grave dark eyes too set back under a broad forehead after crossing the stile at the mill house mrs blake took the path leading back to the negro cabins she must stop to see aunt jezebel the oldest of the colbert negroes who had been failing for some time mrs blake was always called where there was illness she had skill and experience in nursing was certainly a better help to the sick than the country doctor who had never been away to any medical school but treated his patients from buchans family medicine book on being told that aunt jezebel was asleep mrs blake passed the kitchen separated from the dwelling by thirty feet or so and entered the house by the back door which the servants used when they carried hot food from the kitchen to the diningroom in covered metal dishes as she went down the long carpeted passage toward mrs colberts bedchamber she heard her mothers voice in angeranger with no heat a cold sneering contempt take it down this minute you know how to do it right take it down i told you hairpins do no good now youve hurt me stubborn then came a smacking sound three times the wooden back of a hairbrush striking someones cheek or arm mrs blakes firm mouth shut closer as she knocked the same voice asked forbiddingly who is there its only rachel as mrs blake opened the door her mother spoke coolly to a young girl crouching beside her chair you may go now and see that you come back in a better humour the girl flitted by mrs blake without a sound her face averted and her shoulders drawn together mrs colbert in her wheelchair was sitting at a dressingtable before a gilt mirror a white combingcloth about her shoulders this she threw off as her daughter entered take a chair rachel youre early she spoke politely but she evidently meant too early yes im earlier than i calculated i stopped to see old jezebel but she was asleep so i came right on in mrs colbert smiled she was always amused when people behaved in character sooner than disturb a sick negro woman rachel had come in to disturb her at her dressing hour when it was understood she did not welcome visits from anyone how like rachel for all mrs blake could see her mothers greyandchestnut hair was in perfect order combed up high from the neck and braided in a flat oval on the crown with wavy wings coming down on either side of her forehead you might get me a fresh cap out of the upper drawer rachel i hate a frowsy head in the morning thank you i can arrange it she pinned the small frill of ribbon and starched muslin over the flat oval now she said affably you might turn me a little so that i can see you her chair was carved walnut with a cane back and downcurved arms one of the diningroom chairs made over for her use by mr whitford the country carpenter and coffinmaker he had cushioned it and set it on a walnut platform with iron castors underneath mrs blake turned it so that her mother sat in the sunlight and faced the east windows instead of the lookingglass well i suppose it is a good thing jezebel can sleep so much mrs blake shook her head till cant get her to eat anything shes weaker every day shell not last long mrs colbert smiled archly at her daughters solemn face she has managed to last a good while something into ninety years i shouldnt care to last that long should you no mrs blake admitted then i dont think we need make long faces she has been well taken care of in her old age and her last sickness i mean to go out to see her perhaps today rachel i have a letter here from sister sarah i must read you mrs colbert took out her glasses from a reticule attached to the arm of her chair she read the letter from winchester chiefly to put an end to conversation she knew her daughter must have heard her correcting nancy and therefore would be glum and disapproving never having owned any servants herself rachel didnt at all know how to deal with them rachel had always been difficultrebellious toward the fixed ways which satisfied other folk mrs colbert had been heartily glad to get her married and out of the house at seventeen while the letter was being read mrs blake sat regarding her mother and thought she looked very well for a woman who had been dropsical nearly five years true her malady had taken away her colour she was always pale now and in the morning something puffy under the eyes but the eyes themselves were clear a lively greenish blue with no depth her face was pleasant very attractive to people who were not irked by the slight shade of placid selfesteem she bore her disablement with courage seldom referred to it sat in her crude invalids chair as if it were a seat of privilege she could stand on her feet with a good air when visitors came could walk to the private closet behind her bedroom on the arm of her maid her speech like her handwriting was more cultivated than was common in this backcountry district her daughter sometimes felt a kind of false pleasantness in the voice yet she reflected as she listened to the letter it was scarcely falseit was the only kind of pleasantness her mother hadnot very warm as mrs colbert finished reading mrs blake said heartily that is surely a good letter aunt sarah always writes a good letter mrs colbert took off her glasses glancing at her daughter with a mischievous smile you are not put out because she makes fun of your baptists a little no shes a right to id never have joined with the baptists if i could have got to winchester to our own church but a body likes to have some place to worship and the baptists are good people so your father thinks but then he never did mind to forgather with common people i suppose that goes with a millers business yes the common folks hereabouts have got to have flour and meal and theres only one mill for them to come to mrs blakes voice was rather tart she wished it hadnt been when her mother said unexpectedly and quite graciously well youve surely been a good friend to them rachel mrs blake bade her mother goodbye and hurried down the passage at times she had to speak out for the faith that was in her faith in the baptists not so much as a sect she still read her english prayer book every day but as wellmeaning men and women leaving the house by the back way she saw the laundry door open and nancy inside at the ironingboard she turned from her path and went into the laundry cabin well nancy how are you getting on she habitually spoke to people of nancys world with a resolute cheerfulness which she did not always feel the yellow girl flashed a delighted smile showing all her white teeth purty well mam purty well oh do set down miz blake she pushed a chair with a broken back in front of her ironingboard her eyes brightened with eager affection though the lids were still red from crying go on with your ironing child i wont hinder you is that one of mothers caps pointing to a handful of damp lace which lay on the white sheet yesm this is one of her compny ones i likes to have em nice she shook out the ball of crumpled lace blew on it and began to run a tiny iron about in the gathers this is a lil childs iron i coaxed it of miss sadie garrett she didnt use it for nothin an its mighty handy fur the caps yes i see it is youre a good ironer nancy thank you mam mrs blake sat watching nancys slender nimble hands so flexible that one would say there were no hard bones in them at all they seemed compressible like a childs they were just a shade darker than her face if her cheeks were pale gold her hands were what mrs blake called old gold she was considering nancys case as she sat there the red marks of the hairbrush were still on the girls right arm wondering how much she grieved over the way things were going nancy had fallen out of favour with her mistress everyone knew it and no one knew why selfrespecting negroes never complained of harsh treatment they made a joke of it and laughed about it among themselves as the rough mountain boys did about the lickings they got at school nancy had not been trained to humility until lately mrs colbert had shown her marked favouritism gave her pretty clothes to set off her pretty face and liked to have her in attendance when she had guests or drove abroad well child i must be going mrs blake said presently she left the laundry and walked about the negro quarters to look at the multitude of green jonquil spears thrusting up in the beds before the cabins they would soon be in bloom easter flowers was her name for them but the darkies called them smoke pipes because the yellow blossoms were attached to the green stalk at exactly the angle which the bowl of their clay pipes made with the stem iii the mill house was of a style well known to all virginians since it was built on very much the same pattern as mount vernon two storeys with a steeppitched roof and dormer windows it stood long and thin and a front porch supported by square frame posts ran the length of the house from this porch the broad green lawn sloped down a long way to a white picket fence where the mill yard began its boxhedged walks were shaded by great sugar maples and old locust trees all was orderly in front flowerbeds shrubbery and a lilac arbour trimmed in an arch beneath which a tall man could walk behind the house lay another world a helter skelter scattering like a small village some ten yards from the back door of the house was the kitchen entirely separate from it according to the manner of that time the negro cabins were much farther away the cabins the laundry and the big twostorey smokehouse were all draped with flowering vines now just coming into leafbud virginia creeper trumpet vine dutchmans pipe morningglories but the south side of every cabin was planted with the useful gourd vine which grew faster than any other creeper and bore flowers and fruit at the same time in summer the big yellow blossoms kept unfolding every morning even after the many little gourds had grown to such a size one wondered how the vines could bear their weight the gourds were left on the vine until after the first frost then gathered and put to dry when they were hard they were cut into dippers for drinking and bowls for holding meal butter lard gravy or any tidbit that might be spirited away from the big kitchen to one of the cabins whatever was carried away in a gourd was not questioned the gourd vessels were invisible to good manners from easter on there would be plenty of flowers growing about the cabins but no grass the back yard was hardbeaten clay earth yellow in the sun orderly only on sundays throughout the working week clotheslines were strung about flapping with red calico dresses mens shirts and blue overalls the ground underneath was littered with old brooms spades and hoes and the rag dolls and homemade toy wagons of the negro children except in a downpour of rain the children were always playing there in company with kittens puppies chickens ducks that waddled up from the millpond turkey gobblers which terrorized the little darkies and sometimes bit their naked black legs when sapphira dodderidge colbert first moved out to back creek valley with her score of slaves she was not warmly received in that outoftheway thinly settled district between winchester and romney not a single family had ever owned more than four or five negroes this was due partly to povertythe people were very poor much of the land was still wild forest and lumber was so plentiful that it brought no price at all the settlers who had come over from pennsylvania did not believe in slavery and they owned no negroes mrs colbert had gradually reduced her force of slaves selling them back into loudoun county whither they were glad to return her husband had needed ready money to improve the old mill here there were no large rich farms for the blacks to work as there were in loudoun county many fieldhands were not needed sapphira dodderidge usually acted upon motives which she disclosed to no one that was her nature her friends in her own county could never discover why she had married henry colbert they spoke of her marriage as a long step down the colberts were termed immigrantsas were all settlers who did not come from the british isles old gabriel colbert the grandfather came from somewhere in flanders henrys own father was a plain man a miller and he trained his eldest son to that occupation the three younger sons were birds of a very different feather they rode with a fast foxhunting set being shrewd judges of horses they were welcome in every mans stable they were even with a shade of contempt and only occasionally received in good houses not the best houses to be sure henry was a plain hardworking littlespeaking young man who stayed at home and helped his father with his father he regularly attended a dissenting church supported by small farmers and artisans he was certainly no match for captain dodderidges daughter true when sapphiras two younger sisters were already married she at the age of twentyfour was still single she saved her face people said by making it clear that she was bound down by the care of her invalid father captain dodderidge had been seriously hurt while out hunting in taking a stone wall his horse had fallen on him he survived his injury for three years after his death when the property was divided sapphira announced her engagement to henry colbert who had never gone to her fathers house except on matters of business after the captain was crippled and ailing he often sent for young henry to advise him about selling his grain to write his business letters and to keep an eye on the nominal steward he had great confidence in henrys judgment sapphira was usually present at their business conferences and took some part in their discussions about the management of the farm lands and stock it was she who rode over the estate to see that the masters orders were carried out she went to the public sales on market days and bought in cattle and horses of which she was a knowing judge when the increase of the flocks or the stables was to be sold she attended to it with henrys aid when the increase of the slave cabins was larger than needed for field and house service she sold off some of the younger negroes captain dodderidge never sold the servants who had been with his family for a long while after they were past work they lived on in their old cabins well provided for when sapphira announced her engagement the family friends were more astonished than if she had declared her intention of marrying the gardener they quizzed the negro servants who declared that mr henry had never been so much as asked into the parlour they had never caught him talking to miss sapphy outside her fathers room much less courting her after all these years the strangeness of this marriage still came up in conversation when old friends got together fat lizzie the cook had whispered to the neighbours on back creek folks back home says it seem like missy an mr henry wasnt scarcely acquainted befo de weddin nor very close acquainted evah since him bein kep so close at de mill she would add suavely since she did marry henry it was not hard to explain why sapphira had moved away from her native county where his plain manners his calling vague ancestry even his lutheran connections would have made her social position rather awkward once removed several days journey from her old friends she could go back to visit them without embarrassment the millers unbending somewhat uncouth figure need never appear upon the scene at all the bride chose back creek for her place of exile because she owned a very considerable property there willed to her by an uncle who died when she was still a young girl on this back creek estate there was a mill it had stood there for some generations since revolutionary times this farm and a great tract of forest land afterward sold off had been deeded by thomas lord fairfax to a nathaniel dodderidge who came out to virginia with fairfax in 1747 fairfaxs actual possessions in the colony were immense something like five million acres of forest and mountain which had never been surveyed watered by rivers great and small which had never been explored except by the indians and were nameless except for their unpronounceable indian names there was discontent in the virginia assembly that so large a territory should be held in one grant when fairfax established his final residence in the shenandoah valley he quieted this dissatisfaction by deeding off portions of his estate to desirable settlers laying out towns and in every way encouraging immigration to nathaniel dodderidge he deeded a tract of land on back creek neither nathaniel nor any of his descendants had ever lived on this land it was only after the capture of quebec by young general wolfe in 1759 that the mountainous country between winchester and romney was altogether safe for settlers bands of indians under french captains had burned and slaughtered as near back creek as the capon river when the danger of indian raids was over someone his name was lost built a water mill where henry colberts mill now stood all through the revolutionary war and ever since a mill on that site had served the needs of the scattered settlers the dodderidges had let the mill farm to tenants for successive generations sapphiras father had never seen the place but before his death sapphira herself attended by a groom rode up a four days journey on horseback to look over her inheritance one morning she arrived at the back creek post office where a spare room was kept for travellers sapphira unpacked her saddlebags and settled herself for a stay of several days she rode all over the mill farm and the timber land had a friendly interview with the resident miller and told him she could not renew his lease which had barely a year to run before sapphiras marriage to henry colbert carpenters were sent out from winchester to pull down the old mill house it was scarcely more than a cabin and to build the comfortable dwelling which now stood there when the new house was completed sapphiras household goods were carted up from chestnut hill and settled in it she and henry colbert were married at christ church in winchester and drove directly to the new mill house on back creek omitting the elaborate festivities which customarily followed a wedding though it was often said that miss dodderidge had broken away from her rightful station she by no means dropped out of the lives of her family or lost touch with her friends until her illness came upon her she made every year a long visit to the sister who lived at chestnut hill the old estate in loudoun county even now she was always driven to winchester in march to stay with her sister sarah until after easter there she attended all the services at christ church where lord fairfax the first patron of the virginia dodderidges was buried beneath the chancel with the help of her brotherinlaw and a cane she limped to the family pew though she was obliged to remain seated throughout the service she was a comely figure in the congregation clad in black silk and white fichu from lack of exercise she had grown somewhat stout but she wore stays of the severest make and carried her shoulders high her serene face and lively shallow blue eyes smiled at old friends from under a black velvet bonnet renewed or freshened yearly by the town milliner she had not at all the air of a countrywoman come to town no dodderidge who ever sat in that pew showed her blood to better advantage the miller of course did not accompany her although he had been married in christ church by an english rector he had no love for the church of england iv mrs colbert in her morning jacket and cap sat before her desk writing a letter she wrote with pauses for deliberation which was unusual she was not unhandy with the pen when writing to her sisters she filled pages with small neat script having trained herself to write small postage was accounted dear and when she sent long letters to relatives in england it was an economy to put a great deal upon a sheet this morning she was composing a letter to a nephewa letter of invitation it was meant to be cordial but not too cordial when she felt satisfied with it she folded the sheet and sealed it with a dab of red wax envelopes were little in use she rang the loudvoiced copper bell always kept in the side pocket of her chair old washington appeared yes missy i am minded to drive out washington i have ordered the carriage and uncle jeff must have it at the door presently find till and tell her to come and get me ready yes mam mrs colbert turned her letter facedown upon her desk till could read and the mistress did not wish her to see to whom the letter was addressed when the neat black woman came to the door mrs colbert said cheerfully now till you must dress me to drive abroad yes missy the black cashmere i reckon its a wonderful nice day outside miss sapphy itll do you good till nancys mother was a black woman of about forty straight and spare her carriage and deportment and speech were those of a welltrained housekeeper she knew how to stand when receiving orders how to meet visitors at the front door how to make them comfortable in the parlour and see to their wants she had been trained as parlour maid by the english housekeeper whom sapphiras mother had brought with her from devon when she came out to virginia to marry her american cousin the housekeeper had seen in till a likely girl who could be taught since mrs colbert had lost the use of her feet till had charge of everything in the house except the kitchen and fat lizzie the cook whom no one but mrs colbert could control till set about dressing her mistress took off the morning jacket and slipped a starched white petticoat and a cashmere dress over mrs colberts head dont raise yourself up miss sapphy ill pull everything down when you has to rise now the feet i suppose said mrs colbert with a shrug she seldom permitted herself to sigh not the silk stockings i shant be getting out anywhere but you can put on the new kid leather shoes they hurt me but i must be getting used to them now just you wear the cloth slippers and be easy miss sapphy let me wear the kid shoes round the house a few days more an break em in for you hush till you mustnt baby me her mistress joked looking wishfully at the cloth slippers which till was flapping on her two hands like mittens well put them on me but this is the last time you cant do much at breaking in the new pair for you have small feet almost as small as mine used to be she regarded her feet and ankles with droll contempt while till drew on the stockings and tied a ribbon garter below each of her waxwhite swollen knees theres jeff now till exclaimed as she tied the strings of her mistresss secondbest bonnet she helped her to rise for a moment and pulled down the full skirts washington came at call and pushed mrs colberts chair through the long hall to the front door outside stood the coach freshly washed it looked very much like the fourwheeler public cab of later days on the box sat a shrivelledup old negro in a black coat much too big for him and all that was left of a coachmans hat a little black boy came running up to hold the horses while jeff descended to help his mistress leaning between jeff and washington mrs colbert crossed the porch and stepped down into the carriage she settled herself on the leather cushions and jefferson was about to close the door when she said quite carelessly jefferson what have you got on your feet jeff crouched he had nothing at all on his feet they were as bare as on the day he was born ah thought nobodyd see mah feet on de box missy you did take me out driving like some mountain trash would you now you get out of my sight and put on that pair of mr henrys boots i gave you step jefferson scuttled off like an old rat washington went to help the boy hold the impatient horses till was leaning in at the carriage door putting a cushion under her mistresss slippers and a rug over her knees till said mrs colbert confidentially i wish you would tell me why its so hard to keep leather on a niggers feet i jest dont know miss sapphy the last thing i done was to caution that nigger about his boots when i seen him wrigglin his old crooked toes yonder in the gravel i was that shamed till spoke indignantly she was ashamed jeff was her husband had been these many years though it was by no will of hers jeff came back his pants stuffed into a pair of old boots which needed blacking and hurriedly climbed on to the box jeff you drive careful now till called washington and the black boy stepped back from the horses and the coach rolled down the driveway the drive led past the mill and sampson the head millhand came out to wave and call pleasant drive to you miss sapphy to the household it was an occasion when the mistress drove out in this backwoods country there were few families mrs colbert cared to call upon and she had no special liking for rough mountain roads when the wild laurel was in bloom or the wild honeysuckle rhododendron nudiflorum then she often drove up the winding road to timber ridge she knew she looked to advantage when she stopped to pass the time of day with her neighbours through the lowered window of her coach very few people even in loudoun county had glass windows in their carriages moreover on the coach door there was a small patch of colour the dodderidge crest her coat of arms the back creek people called it the children along the road used to stare wonderingly at that mysterious stamp of superiority this morning when jefferson came to the place where the mill road turned into the highroad he asked in his cracked treble whichaway missy she told him to the post office so he turned west when he had gone a mile he slowed his horses to a walk there was mrs blakes house standing under four great maple trees in a neat yard with a white paling fence two little girls ran out calling good morning granma jefferson stopped the carriage and mrs colbert asked after their mother ma aint at home said the older child shes gone over to peughtown mrs thatchers dreadful sick they came for ma in the night and brought a horse for her so you are all by yourselves suppose you get in and take a ride to the post office the children shot quick glances at each other the younger one who was only eight said timidly weve got just our old dresses on granma her grandmother laughed oh never mind this time jump in the horses dont like to stand mollys curls are nice anyhow the children climbed into the carriage delighted at their good luck sometimes when their grandmother was driving of a sunday morning she stopped and took them and their mother as far as the baptist church but very seldom had they driven out with her by themselves this was saturday and molly wished that all her schoolmates could be loitering along the road to see them go by her real name was mary but since she promised to be a pretty girl her grandmother had taken a fancy to her and called her molly it was understood that this name was mrs colberts special privilege her mother and her schoolmates called her mary her little sister was the only one who dared to use grandmothers name for her uncle jeff drew his horses up before the long low whitepainted house where the postmistress lived and performed her official duties the postmistress herself threw an apron over her head and came out to the carriage she and mrs colbert greeted each other with marked civility they held very different opinions on one important subject mrs colbert drew from her reticule the letter she had written a few hours ago i brought this letter up to you myself mrs bywaters because it is important and i hope you will put it into the mailbag yourself certainly mrs colbert nobody but me ever handles the mail here the bag goes from my hands into the stagedrivers i see youve got your little granddaughters along today yes mrs bywaters this is a pleasant day for a drive id heard you had your house new painted how nice it looks thank you i had trouble enough getting it done but its over at last i had to tear down all my honeysuckle vines and lay them on the ground im hoping theyre not much hurt i hope not indeed they were a great ornament to your house especially the coral honeysuckle now jefferson we will stop at the store for a minute good day to you mrs bywaters the country store stood across the road from the post office the storekeeper saw the carriage stop and came out mrs colbert asked him to bring her a pound of stick candy half wintergreen and half peppermint both little girls tried to look unconscious but while their grandmother was talking to the storekeeper betty pinched mary softly to express her feelings the candy was brought out in a brown paper parcel but it was not given to them until their grandmother let them out at their own gate they thanked her very prettily for the candy and the drive jefferson you may take me down the turnpike and out to mrs cowpers on the peughtown road i want to ask after my carpets as she drove along mrs colbert was thinking it was fortunate that for once her daughter had been called to nurse in a prosperous family like the thatchers who would see that she was well repaid if not in money in hams or bacon or a bolt of good cloth usually she was called out to some bare mountain cabin where she got nothing but thanks and likely as not had to take along milk and eggs and her own sheets for the poor creature who was sick rachel was poor and it was not much use to give her things whatever she had she took where it was needed most and mrs colbert certainly didnt intend to keep the whole mountain after a few miles of jolting over a rough byroad she stopped for a call on mrs cowper the carpetweaver at the mill house all wornout garments discarded table linen and old sheets were cut into narrow strips sewn together and wound into fat balls this was the darkies regular evening work in winter when a great many balls of these carpetrags had accumulated they were sent with hanks of cotton chain to mrs cowper who dyed them with logwood copperas or cochineal then wove them into stout carpets striped or plain v as soon as the mistress had left the house till and her daughter nancy fell to and began to give her bedroom a thorough cleaning pushed the bed out from the wall and washed the closet floors all the windows were opened and the rugs before the washbasin stand and the dressingtable were carried into the back yard and beaten after nancy had pinned a clean antimacassar on the back of the wheelchair and put the mistresss slippers ready at the foot of it her mother said they might as well give the parlour a lick before the carriage got back the two women their heads tied up in red cotton handkerchiefs went into the parlour and rolled up the green paper shades painted with garden scenes and fountains the sunlight streamed into the room the parlour was long in shape not square with a low ceiling the brick fireplace in the middle under a wide mantel shelf horsehair chairs and sofas sat about with tidies on their backs and arms captain dodderidges old mahogany desk filled one corner every inch of the floor was covered by a heavy wilton carpet figured with pink roses and green leaves it was somewhat worn as it had been brought over by sapphiras mother when she first came out to virginia upon this carpet the two brooms went swiftly to work the room had an air of settled comfort and stability visitors sensed that at once the deepset windows made one feel the thickness of the walls a child could climb up into one of those windows and make a playhouse every afternoon mrs colbert was brought into the parlour and sat here for several hours before supper here she could watch the light of the sinking sun burn on the great cedars that grew along the farther side of the creek across from the mill in winter weather when the snow was falling over the flower garden and the hedges that long room with its six windows and its warm hearth was a pleasant place to be with nancy at one end and till at the other the parlour was soon swept till never dawdled over her work the housekeeper at chestnut hill had taught her that the shuffling foot was the mark of an inferior race after the sweeping came the dusting now nancy run and fetch me a kitchen chair and a clean soft rag i want to git at the potraits which i didnt have time to do last week any other servant on the place would have stepped coolly on one of the fat horsehair chairbottomsif indeed she had thought it worth while to dust the pictures at all now that the mistress could no longer reach up and run her fingers along the frames when the wooden chair was brought till mounted and wiped first the canvases then their heavy gilt frames her daughter stood gazing up at them master and mistress twenty years ago mistress in a garnet velvet gown and real lace wearing her long earrings and a garnet necklace a vigorous young woman with chestnut hair and a high colour in her cheeks the master in a stock and broadcloth coat his bushy black hair standing up as it often did now his face broad and ruddy he had changed very little nancy thought these pictures wonderful she hoped the painter was really her father as some folks said old jezebel her greatgrandmother had whispered to her that was why she had straight black hair with no kink in it anyway nancy knew uncle jeff wasnt her father though she always called him pappy and treated him with respect her mother had no children by uncle jeff and fat lizzie the cook had left nancy in no doubt as to the reason when nancy was a little girl lizzie had coaxed her off into the bushes one sunday to help her pick gooseberries there she told her how miss sapphy had married till off to jeff because he was a capon man the child was puzzled and thought this meant that jeff had come from somewhere up on the capon river but lizzie made the facts quite clear miss sapphy didnt want a ladys maid to be havin chillun all over de place always acarryin or anussin em so she married till off to jeff and made it wuth her while the niggers reckoned till got the light end of the work and the best of everything and lizzie didnt believe that talk about the painter man she told nancy that one of mr henrys brothers was her real father from that day nancy had felt a horror of lizzie she tried not to show it but lizzie knew and she got back at the stuckup piece whenever she had a chance she set her own daughter bluebell to spy on tills girl nancy had never asked till who her father was she admired her mother and took pride in what she called her mothers nice ways the girl had a natural delicacy of feeling ugly sights and ugly words sickened her she had tills good mannerswith something warmer and more alive but she was not courageous when the servants were gossiping at their midday dinner in the big kitchen if she sensed a dirty joke coming she slipped away from the table and ran off into the garden if she felt a reprimand coming she sometimes lied lied before she had time to think or to tell herself that she would be found out in the end she caught at any pretext to keep off blame or punishment for an hour a minute she didnt tell falsehoods deliberately to get something she wanted it was always to escape from something nancy was startled out of her reflections about her mysterious father by her mothers voice now honey if i was you id make a nice eggnog when you hear the carriage comin an id carry it in to the mistress when shes got out of the coach an into her room id take it to her on the small silvah salvah with a white napkin and some cold biscuit nancy caught her breath and looked downcast lizzie she dont like to have me meddlin round the kitchen to do anything ill be out around the kitchen an lizzie dassent say anything to me an if i was you i wouldnt carry a tray to missus with no haingdawg look id smile an look happy to serve her an shell smile back nancy shook her head her slender hands dropped limp at her side no she wont mudder very low yes she will if you smile right an dont go shiverin like a drownded kitten in all loudoun county miss sapphy was knowed for her good mannahs an that she knowed how to treat all folks in their degree the daughter hesitated but did not answer for nearly a year now she had seemed to have no degree and her mistress had treated her like an untrustworthy stranger before that ever since she could remember miss sapphy had been very kind to her had liked her and had shown it as they were leaving the parlour nancy murmured more to herself than to her mother i knows that fat lizzies at the bottom of it somehow shes always got a pick on me vi the mill stood on the west bank of back creek the big waterwheel hung almost over the stream itself the creek ran noisily along over a rough stone bottom which here and there churned the dark water into foam for the most part it was wide and shallow though there were deep holes between the ledges the dam lying in the green meadows above the mill was fed by springs and a race conveyed the water to the big wooden wheel in the second storey of the mill flour and unground grain were stored there it was safe in times of high water the millers room on the first floor was a recognized feature of every mill in those days the man in charge slept there and kept an eye on the property even when no grinding was going on at night henry colbert had no foreman he himself occupied the room using it both as sleepingchamber and office years ago he spent the night at the mill only in times of night grinding or high water but latterly the mill room had become more and more the place where he actually lived the mill room was all that was left of the original building which stood there in revolutionary times the old chimney was still sound and the miller used the slatepaved fireplace in cold weather the floor was bare old boards very wide axhewn from great trees before the day of sawmills there was no ceiling but the floor of the storeroom above with its heavy axdressed crossbeams this wooden ceiling its beams and the wooden walls of the room were freshly whitewashed every spring the millers furniture was whitewashed so to speak day by day by the flour dust which sifted down from overhead and through every crack and crevice in the doors and walls each morning tills nancy swept and dusted the flour away here the miller had arranged everything to his own liking the square windows were furnished with paper blinds to keep out the fouroclock summer dawn if he had been up late the night before his narrow bed had been made of chestnut wood by mr whitford the neighbourhood carpenter and cabinetmaker and it was a good piece of work bedcords hitched about neat knobs took the place of springs on the tightly drawn cords lay the mattress a feather tick in winter a cornshuck one in summer his secretary was also of chestnut whitford liked to work in that wood it was both writingdesk and bookcase above the desk four shelves held ledgers and account booksand a curious assortment of other books as well the high chest of drawers at which the miller shaved stood between the two west windows looking toward the house and his small woodframed lookingglass hung from a nail driven in the plank wall behind at seven oclock every morning little zach ran down from the house with the masters shaving water in a steaming iron teakettle when henry colbert first took over the mill his silent unconvivial nature was against him a miller was expected to be jovial to produce whisky or at least applejack when a man made a small payment on a long account in time his neighbours found that though the new miller was stingy of speech he was not tight with his pursestrings one rainy march day at about four oclock in the afternoon in virginia one said four oclock in the evening the miller was sitting at his secretary going through his ledger his purpose was to check off the names of debtors to whom he would not under any circumstance extend further credit he found so many of these names already checked once and even twice that after frowning over his accounts for a long while he leaned back in his chair and rubbed his chin when people were so poor what was a christian man to do they were poor because they were lazy and shiftless or at best bad managers well he couldnt make folks over he guessed and they had to eat while he sat thinking sampson his head millhand appeared at the door which was often left ajar in the daytime mr henry little zach jist run down from de house sayin de mistress would like you to come up if you aint too busy the miller closed his ledger glad to escape anything amiss sampson no sah i dont reckon so zach he said she was waitin in de parlour colbert changed his old leather jacket for a black coat brushed the flourdust off his broad hat and walked up through the cold spring drizzle which was making the grass green he found his wife dressed for the afternoon with a lace cap on her head and her rings on her fingers having her tea by the fire when she heard him open the front door she poured his cup smuggling in a good tot of jamaica rum since he didnt take cream before he sat down he took up a plate of toasted biscuit from the hearth and offered it to his wife he drank his tea in a few swallows though it was very hot thank you sapphy that takes the chill out of a bodys bones it does get damp down there at the mill could you spare me another cup munching his biscuit he watched her pour the tea when she reached down for a small red cruet well concealed on the lower deck of the table he laughed and rubbed his hands together thats why it tastes so good i must try to get up here oftener when youre having your tea but its just about this time of day the farmers come in the good ones are at work all morning and the poor sticks never get around to anything at all till the days most gone im sure the master would always be very welcome company in the evenings replied mrs colbert lifting her eyebrows whether archly or ironically it would be hard to say dont you put on with me sapphy he reached down to the hearth for another biscuit youre the master here and im the miller and thats how i like it to be his wife looked at him with an indulgent smile and shook her head she stirred her tea gently for a few moments in silence a log fell apart in the fire and shot up tall flames the miller put the ends together with the tongs henry she said suddenly do you realize its getting on towards easter and you havent set out yet he added have you given up going for this year no i wouldnt disappoint sister sarah but jezebels been so low i shouldnt like to be away from home when it happened i thought she would have gone before this colbert glanced up in surprise well you neednt put yourself out on jezebels account she may hang on till harvest it seems like life wont let go of her if you feel that way whats to hinder my going this friday then i would have all holy week with sarah and if i get no bad news from home i might stay a week longer sarah always entertains after easter you know and i would meet my old friends i can see no objection the roads ought to be good if this drizzle dont set into a hard rain while youre in town you might have the carriage painted it needs it thats a good idea and this year i think i shall take nancy along instead of till it would smarten her up to see how people do things in town he considered a moment very well if you leave till to look after my place down there dont try any more bluebell on me his wife replied with her most ladylike laugh a flash of fun in it poor bluebell is she never to have a chance to learn why are you so set against her i cant abide her or anything about her if there is one nigger on the place i could thrash with my own hands its that bluebell the mistress threw up her hands this time she laughed so heartily that the rings on her fingers glittered it was a treat to hear her husband break out like this well henry as she wiped her eyes with a tiny handkerchief i will own to you that if it wasnt for lizzies feelings id send that lazy girl off the place tomorrow id give her away but weve got the only good cook west of winchester and so we have to have bluebell lizzie would always be in the sulks and when a cook is out of temper she can spoil every dish just by a turn of the hand we would never sit down to a good dinner again besides your baptists would miss lizzie and bluebell in the hymns and they are always being sent for to sing at funerals i like to hear them myself of a summer night the miller rose put another log on the fire and by way of an attention righted the clumsy wheelchair a little he took his wifes plump hand and patted it thank you for having me up sapphy its done me good the mill room gets very damp between seasons and i forget to have tap make a fire you might send for me a little oftener he turned up his coatcollar and reached for his hat but his wife interfered go and get your shawl out of the hall press dont go back to the mill and sit in a damp coat its folly to expose yourself you ought to have a fire every day this weather he went into the hall and returned with a great shawl of fine scotch wool it had once been dark green but time and weather had put a dull gold cast into it he folded it threecornered so that it covered his coat and went out into the drizzle military men and prosperous townsmen wore overcoats but farmers and countrymen wore heavy shawls fastened with a large shawlpin sapphira sat looking out at the dripping trees and the thick amethyst clouds which hung low over the mill and blurred the tall cedars across the creek she smiled faintly it occurred to her that when they were talking about bluebell both she and henry had been thinking all the while about nancy how much she wondered did each wish to conceal from the other such speculations were mildly amusing for a woman who did not read a great deal and who had to sit in a chair all day she had given little time to reflection in the years when she was having her children and bringing them up even after they were married and gone the management of the place had kept her busy every year there was the gardening and planting butchering time and meatcuring summer meant preserving and jellymaking the drying of cherries and currants and sweet corn and sliced apples for winter in those days she often rode her mare to winchester of a saturday to be there for the sunday service it was because she had been so energetic and such a good manager that even from an invalids chair she was still able to keep her servants well in hand book ii nancy and till i on thursday morning two leather coach trunks were brought down from the garret and nancy was allowed for the first time to pack them under tills direction besides the trunks there was a handy whitfordmade wooden box for shoes as the poor mistress had to carry so many pairs the bandboxes were to go inside the carriage by eleven oclock on friday morning mrs colbert was dressed and bonneted all the household gathered round the carriage to see her off fat lizzie brought the lunchbox for light refreshment on the road to winchester the miller came up from the mill to lift his wife into the carriage nancy in her sunday bonnet and shawl stood by expecting to sit on the box with uncle jeff but mrs colbert told her she was to ride inside the servants called good wishes as jeff drove off and henry walked beside the coach as far as the mill nancy had cast an appealing glance at her mother when she learned she was to sit beside the mistress but till knew the dodderidge manners if the girl was taken as a companion she would be treated as such after till had closed the mistresss room she went down to the mill to straighten up for mr henry she had her own sense of the appropriate and she thought the millers room right for him in the same way that captain dodderidges saddle room had always been right she approved of the polished chestnut bedstead and the counterpane in large blue and white squares woven by the same mrs cowper who made carpets the four brass candlesticks by which the miller read after dark were clean and shining only a little tallow from last night had dripped down the stems the deep chair beside the readingtable was made of bent hickory withes very strong and well fitted to the back till had wanted to make cushions for this chair but the master told her cushions were for women she was glad to see that nancy had kept mr henrys copper pieces bright she knew he set great store by these between the whitewashed uprights that held the board walls together the miller had fitted wooden shelves on these he kept sharp and delicate tools which the millhands were on no account allowed to touch and a row of copper bowls and tankards which had been his grandfathers nancy had been keeping the mill room in order ever since she was twelve years old there was nothing down there that could be damaged or broken the mistress had remarked to till yet the work would be training of a sort this morning till examined everything critically the bedcords the sheets and blankets the hand washbasin the drawer with soap and towels for the millers private use she couldnt have kept the room better herself she thought on her way back to the house till fell to wondering for the hundredth time why nancy had fallen out of favour with the mistress to be sure until lately miss sapphy had pampered the girl too much but it wasnt a dodderidge trait to turn on anybody they had once taken a fancy to nancy herself till knew suspected fat lizzie as the troublemaker but she had never said why old washington could have given till some hint as to how this change in the mistress had come about but washington was close mouthed long service had taught him that tattling was sure to get a houseman into trouble nearly a year ago in the month of may an unfortunate incident had occurred the mistress sitting at the table after her husband had finished his breakfast and gone to the mill heard loud voices from the kitchen the windows and doors were open to let the fresh spring air blow through the house she recognized fat lizzies rolling tones and suspected she was bullying one of the other servants washington was standing behind the mistresss chair she beckoned him to help her rise took his arm and limped painfully to the back door this was what she heard not lizzies voice now but nancys you dasnt talk to me that way lizzie i wont bear it ill go to the master then lizzie with a big laugh cose youll go to master aint dat jest what i been tellin you you think you mighty nigh owns dat mill runnin down all times aday and night carryin bokays to him oh i seen you many a time pickin vilets

bed cumfable fur him aint dat nice i speck look out you dont do it once too many den it aint so fine when somethin begin to show on you miss yaller face through lizzies lewd laughter broke the frantic voice of a young thing bursting into tears i wont stay here to listen to your nasty tongue an him de good kind man to every nigger on de place shame on you you bad woman nancy rushed out of the kitchen sobbing her face buried in her hands she did not see her mistress standing in the doorway that very night nancy was ordered to bring her straw tick up from tills cabin and sleep on the floor outside mrs colberts bedroom door she had been sleeping there ever since through the summer lying outside the mistresss door was not a hardshipthe girl had always slept on the floor but when the winter came on drafts blew through the long hall up at the big house and even when she went to bed with her yarn stockings on and had heavy quilts over her the cold kept her awake in the long hours before daybreak on nights when the miller did not go down to the mill but slept in the mistresss room and she was not supposed to need a servant ready at call nancy was sent running across the back yard to tills cabin with her tick in her arms and a glad smile on her face she loved that cabin and all her mothers ways till and old jeff slept in the good room where there was a bedstead nancy spread her mattress on the kitchen floor where she could watch the firelight flicker on the whitewashed walls as the logs burnt down there she felt snug like when she was a little girl and toward morning she could hear all the homelike noises close at hand uncle jeff snoring the roosters crowing the barn dogs barking her mammy would maybe come and put an extra quilt over her and then she would drift off to sleep again a few days after nancy had begun to make her bed outside her mistresss door the miller came to his breakfast one morning with a grim face he greeted his wife soberly sat down and began to eat his ham and eggs in silence when his second cup of coffee had been put at his place he said quietly you may go washington until your mistress rings for you as soon as they were alone he lifted his eyes and looked across the table at his wife sapphira do you know who has been coming down to clean the mill room lately she looked up artlessly from her plate i think it was bluebell dont tell me she meddled with your things bluebell the laziest trashiest wench on the place shell learn henry if she doesnt take hold ill send till down to make her step lively shell do no stepping at all in the mill if i see her there again ill put her out nancy is to look after the mill room as she always has done but nancy is old enough now to be trained for a parlour maid if you wont have bluebell try one of marthas girls till has all the housekeeping to do now since i cant get about she needs nancy here the miller was silent for a moment his first flush of anger had passed when he looked up again he spoke quietly of course the blacks on this place belong to you and i have never interfered with your management of them but i warn you sapphira that i will not have any of the wenches coming down to the mill i dont mean to break in another girl nancy is quiet and quick she knows how i want things and she puts them that way i must ask you to spare her to me for a little while every morning mrs colbert laughed lightly oh certainly if you feel that way about it why take a small matter so seriously its of no importance to me who makes my bed she added with just a shade of scorn yes it is you wouldnt have anybody but till fix your room its not my bed i care about its the girls quiet ways and respectful manner and that she never stops to gossip with my mill hands he said no more but went out into the hall and took up his wide brimmed hatthis morning white with two days flourdust when nancy first began to take care of the mill room she usually went down while the master was at breakfast sometimes she had to go earlier to take his freshly ironed shirts and underwear and put them in his chest of drawers before he locked it for the day after a while she fell into the habit of going early because she got a smile along with his good morning child after her mother and mrs blake there was no one in the world she loved so much as the master she had never had a harsh word from himnot many words at any time to be sure but his kindly greeting made her happy that and the feeling she was of some use to him once on a spring morning when the yellow easter flowers jonquils were just bursting into bloom she had gathered a handful on her way to the mill and put them in one of the copper tankards on the shelf she thought the yellow flowers looked pretty in the copper the miller had already gone to breakfast she didnt know whether she ought to leave them there or not he might not like her taking such a liberty the next morning the flowers were still in the tankard the miller was stropping his razor he turned round as she came in good morning child i wonder who brought me some smokepipes down here nancys yellow cheeks blushed pink i just happened to see em as i was runnin down mr henry i put em in water to keep em fresh an i reckon i forgot em just leave them there i like to see flowers in that stein my father used to drink his malt out of it after that when she could do so unobserved nancy often stopped to pick a bunch of whatever flowers were coming on and took them down to the mill under her apron the miller was a little disappointed when nancy did not tap at his door before he started for the house but he never suggested that she come earlier or delayed his departure by one minute his silver watch was always beside him while he shaved and when the hand reached five minutes to eight he put on his hat the colbert men had a bad reputation where women were concerned that was why in spite of her resemblance to the portrait painter from cuba nancy was often counted as one of the colbert bastards some people said guy colbert was her father others put it on jacob although henry was a true colbert in nature he had not behaved like one and he had never been charged with a bastard the miller lived a rather lonely life indeed after supper he usually sat for an hour in the parlour with his wife then went back to the mill and read the pages of his bible were worn thin and the margins sprinkled with crossreferences when he had lit the four candles on his table and settled himself in his hickory chair he read with his mind as well as his eyes and he questioned he met with contradictions and they troubled him he found a comforter in john bunyan who also had been troubled sometimes he had a bad night and was awake and dressed a long while before little zach ran down from the house with his kettle of shaving water then he used to watch to see the yellow girl come winding along the garden path so happy she wasfree from care like the flowers and the birds he had never realized until bluebell took her place for two days how much love and delicate feeling nancy put into making his bare room as he liked it even when she was scarcely more than a child he had felt her eagerness to please him as she grew older he came to identify her with mercy christianas sweet companion when he read in the second part of his book he saw nancys face and figure plain in mercy ii on the evening after mrs colberts departure for town till felt lonely and downcast all day she had been busy and resolutely cheerful now as the sun was going down behind the hills she sat on the doorstep of her cabin watching the long twilight come on this was the first year she had ever missed the easter trip to winchester with her mistress she was glad nancy had been chosen because it seemed to mean that miss sapphys unaccountable harshness toward the girl was melting but deep in her heart till felt slighted and left behind it was always a great treat for her to stay in judge halsteads town house and to help serve at the dinner parties which mrs halstead gave after easter the third sister mrs bushwell who now owned chestnut hill came to winchester at that time bringing her maid and coachman and from them till could hear about everything that had happened at home since last easter home being always chestnut hill this mill farm on back creek had never been home to till she liked as she said to herself to live among folks not among poor farmers and backwoods people the finer accomplishments she had learned from mrs matchem those of which she was most proud had little chance here before the mistress became an invalid things were better then friends from winchester often came to stay overnight or to spend a week there was some satisfaction in keeping the brass and silver bright the stores of bed linen and table linen bleached in those days miss sapphy used to go back to chestnut hill almost every summer for a long visit with her sister and till went with her sitting there on her doorstep and remembering happier times till found herself shivering she got up and went into the cabin when she came back she had a woolstuffed bedquilt about her shoulders on a still twilight in spring and summer clouds of fleecy mist curled over the low meadow down where the mill dam was all tills secret discontent with the mill farm she expressed by the quiet statement that it was damp even on a sunny washday the sheets were longer drying than they should be in the fall the hoar frost was heavier here than over at mrs blakes place on the big road when till and the mistress came back from their easter fortnight in town and no fires had been lighted in the parlour they found damp spots on the english wallpaper theyve had moisture up here miss sapphy would remark cheerfully all the better for the early roses she would never admit that it was damper here than elsewhere but to till the heavy atmosphere brought a heaviness of heart she was not under any circumstances a gay darky in early childhood at chestnut hill she had suffered a frightful shock one night lying in her trundle bed she was watching her mother dress for the servants new years party she saw her mothers finery catch fire from a candle saw her in flames run screaming out into the winter wind the poor woman was fatally burned before the men could overtake her and beat out the fire as for the child the negroes declared she had been struck dumb and would never speak again she said not a word when they tried to comfort her but looked at them with terrified eyes mrs matchem the housekeeper took till up to the big house and put her into a cot in her own room there away from the emotional darkies she began to sleep naturally again and was soon a quickwitted observant little girlbut a grave and serious one so was mrs matchem serious till was devoted to her strove to imitate her in speech and manner matchem impressed it upon her that there was all the difference in the world between doing things exactly right and doing them somehoworother the little black girl would stand looking up at the tall devonshire woman taking these precepts devoutly to heart to the sly whispers of the under servants that an easier way was just as good she steeled herself as if the bad man himself were whispering in her ear after captain dodderidge died and miss sapphy married and went out to back creek her sister mrs bushwell bought in chestnut hill all mrs bushwells interest was in the stables she left the management of the house entirely to matchem till stayed on working under matchem until she was fifteen then sapphira colbert made a trade for her one summer when she drove down to chestnut hill for her yearly visit mrs colbert took with her a young negro who had a great knack with horses for two winters she had hired him out to the new blacksmith on back creek this smith had come over from pennsylvania and his skill was a wonder to that sleepy community he could not only shoe and doctor horses he built good carts and wagons mrs colbert easily convinced her sister that a boy trained under such a smith would be very useful in her stables she was willing to part with him in exchange for the girl till and a hundred dollars to boot mrs bushwell surprised by this liberal offer closed the deal at once but matchem looked down her long nose and compressed her lips till was not unhappy at the prospect of travel and new scenes she set off in the coach eager and journeyproud but from the first night of her arrival at the mill farm she had felt buried in the deep woods for years to come she was homesick for mrs matchem and the open breezy wellplanted country she had left behind her when sapphira married her off to jefferson who was so much older and whose incapacities were well known among the darkies till accepted this arrangement with perfect dignity how much it hurt her pride no one ever knew perhaps she did not know herself perhaps the strongest desire of her life was to be respectable and wellplaced mrs matchem had taught her to value position it was the right thing for a parlour maid and ladys maid to be always presentable and trim of figure none of the heavy work of a big country house was put upon till she always wore a black dress and white apron neat shoes and stockings some years after she had moved her belongings from her attic chamber in the big house over to jeffs cabin the cuban painter came along to do the portraits he was a long while doing them sitting on the doorstep huddled in her quilt till heard a mournful sound come from the deep woods across the creek the first whippoorwill she sighed how she hated the call of that bird every spring she had to listen to it coming out of this resigned unstirring backcountry another spring and here she still was by the millpond and the damp meadows up yonder at the end of a long road winding through the woods the level line of timber ridge rose like a blue wall when you had crossed the ridge and gone on a ways you came to the capon river till had been that far when the mistress stayed at capon springs to take the baths on beyond that was romney where people of some account lived she had heard in front of her across the creek she could see the wavering slopes of the north mountain no roads up there just a few wheeltracks through woods that never ended cabins miles apart corn patches and potato patches pumpkins maybe till believed the poor white trash up there lived mostly on the squirrels they shot and the pig or two they fed on acorns down here in the valley along the big road that led to winchester there were some sightly farmhouses certainly where welltodo families lived when you got as far as hayfield church the woods began to open up and the country looked more human but it wasnt until she caught sight of the red brick springhouse over the town spring a little this way out of winchester that till felt she was back in the world again how she loved the first glimpse of cobblepaved streets with no mud on them you drove into town by water street lined on either side with neat mansard houses built of pale gray limestone gray but almost blue and not dressed so smooth as to take all the life out of the rugged stone such genteel houses they were opening directly on the street with green window shutters and brass knockers a little walled garden and a hydrant behind each house water street seemed to welcome you to town after you drove on and passed christ church then you came to where the quality lived where judge halstead lived where miss sapphy and nancy were this very night there the houses had porticos with tall columns and were set in lawns shaded by flowering trees how often when judge halsteads mansion was lit up for a party till had stood at the foot of the stairway in the big hall waiting to show the ladies to the upper chambers and help them take off their wraps whenever the manservant heard the crunch of wheels on the driveway and threw open the front door just then till heard a very different sound close at hand old jeff came shuffling along in the dusk he stopped and stood uneasily before the seated figure its agittin right late deery he said in his squeaky voice iii as his wife was always in winchester for holy week the miller customarily took his easter dinner with his daughter and granddaughters this year easter sunday fell early the twenty third of march but it was a bright sunshiny morning and warm for the season he walked across the meadow to accompany mrs blake and her little girls to church the children told him joyfully that mr fairhead the preacher who was also their schoolmaster was coming to dinner it would be like a party for mr fairhead was not old and dismal like most preachers and did not say a long grace while the chicken was getting cold the church was a forlorn weatherboarded building with neither spire nor bell standing on a naked hillside where the rains had washed winding gutters in the gravelly slope it had once been painted red but the boards were now curling from lack of paint it looked like an abandoned factory left to the mercy of the weather in the basement underneath the country day school was kept the miller and his daughter went up four warped plank steps and entered the church once within they separated all the men and boys sat on one side of the aisle the girls and women on the other the pews were long benches with backs but no cushions there was no floor covering of any kind there were no blinds at the dusty windows the peaked shingle roof was supported by whitewashed rafters up under this roof over the front door was the gallery where the coloured people sat it was a rule among the farmers who owned slaves to send them to church on sunday while mrs blake knelt for a few moments in silent prayer mary and betty sat restlessly trying to peep over the hats and sunbonnets in front of them to catch sight of their dear mr fairhead who was in the splintbottom chair behind the pulpit waiting for his congregation to assemble when the scuffling tramp of heavy shoes on the bare floor had ceased mr fairhead rose and said let us pray he closed his eyes and began his invocation in the untempered light which poured through the bare windows he looked a very young man indeed with rosy cheeks and yellow hair he had been sent out into the backwoods to teach the country school and to fill the pulpit though he had not yet been ordained during the long summer vacations he lived in winchester and read divinity with old doctor sellers coming out to back creek on horseback every saturday to conduct the sunday service after the prayer he gave out the hymn read it aloud slowly and distinctly since many of his congregation could not read when he closed his hymnbook the congregation rose old andrew shand a scotchman with wiry red hair and chin whiskers officially led the singing he struck his tuningfork on the back of a bench and began there is a land of pure delight at a weary drawling pace but the colbert negroes and the miller himself immediately broke away from shand and carried the tune along mr fairhead joined in looking up at the gallery for him the singing was the living worship of the sunday services the negroes in the loft sang those bright promises and dark warnings with such fervent conviction fat lizzie and her daughter bluebell could be heard above them all bluebell had a pretty soprano voice but lizzie sang high and low with equal ease the congregation downstairs knew what a limb she was but no one except andy shand ever complained because she took a high hand with the hymns the old people who couldnt read could hear the words when lizzie sang neither could lizzie read but she knew the hymns by heart mr fairhead often wondered how it was that she sounded the letter r clearly when she sang though she didnt when she talked could we but stand where moses stood and view the landscape oer not jordans stream nor deaths cold flood would fright us from that shore when lizzie rolled out the last verse and sat down the young preacher looked up at the gallery not with a smile exactly but with appreciation he often felt like thanking her as for andy shand he hated lizzie and all the colbert negroes his animosity extended to the colberts themselves even about mrs blake he was none so sure after the congregation was dismissed mr fairhead and the miller walked down the road together deep in conversation mrs blake and her girls followed behind she knew her father enjoyed the company of an educated man like fairhead that was why she had asked the preacher to dinner their talk as she listened to it was plain farmer talk to be sure about the early season and the prospects for wheat and hay presently the miller began to ask about the country school and mr fairheads pupils there were bright boys among them the young man insisted some who rode over to school from as far as peughtown there were even boys from the mountain who would do fairly well if they had half a chance there was casper flighthere colbert held up his hand never say flight to me mr fairhead ive ground that mans miserable bit of corn and buckwheat ten years for nothing and on top of that he hangs around the mill and steals honest mens grist my sampson has caught him time and again crawling down from the storeroom at night with a bag in his hand i know all about him mr colbert but if you could see how that corn and buckwheat was raised you wouldnt grudge grinding it for nothing theyve got no horse and this boy casper breaks up the ground in their corn patch and buckwheat field himself he pulls the plough and his mother follows at the plough handles and holds the share in the earth last spring i got mr giffen up on the ridge to lend casper a horse to put in his buckwheat his father came home unexpectedly knocked the boy down took the horse out of the plough and rode up to capon river to go fishing im glad you told me sir if theres any good can come out of the flights god knows id like to help it along i could give this boy work around the place in busy times but you know none of those mountain boys will work along with coloured hands yes i know mr fairhead sighed its the one thing theyve got to feel important aboutthat theyre white its pitiful whenever colbert had a talk with david fairhead he wished he could see more of him he had several times asked the young man to supper at the mill house but he observed that fairhead was not at ease in sapphiras company he was shy and on his guard and sapphira had seemed possessed to puzzle him with light ironies since he was from pennsylvania she considered him an inferior yet her manner with inferiors with the cobbler the butcher the weaver the storekeeper was irreproachable when the old broom pedlar or the wandering tinsmith happened along they were always given a place at the dinner table and she knew just how to talk to them but with fairhead she took on a mocking condescension as if she were all the while ridiculing his simplicity therefore henry figured it out she did not really regard him as an inferior but as an equalof the wrong kind fairhead boarded with mrs bywaters at the post office and sapphira knew that he was northern at heart she laughed and told henry she could smell it on him oh yes she admitted he was not an ignoramus like the country schoolteachers who had been there before him she was glad mary and betty had a teacher who did not chew tobacco in the schoolroom or speak like the mountain people he had doubtless been raised a gentlemanof the pennsylvania kind but he was a mealymouth say what you would and if she made him uncomfortable it was because he hadnt the wit to come back at her how can i talk to a man who blushes every time i poke fun at him or at anybody else youd better give it up henry so the schoolmaster was not invited to the mill house again book iii old jezebel i on the first day after her return from town mrs colbert summoned till and told her she meant to go out to see aunt jezebel this morning i will have a look around the yard first send nancy in to dress me and tell tap to have the boys here in about an hour the boys were young negroes whom tap called in from the barn or the fields to help him carry the mistress on each side of her chair were two iron rings into these the boys thrust dressed hickory saplings and bore mrs colbert about the place tap was one of the millhands but he loved to wait on ladies he was a handsome boy and he knew the mistress thought so he used to make his assistants clean up on these occasions take off dat sweaty ole rag an put on a clean shirt fo de missus this morning the sunshine was so bright that the mistress carried a tiny parasol with a jointed handle her bearers took her along the brick walks bordered by clipped boxwood hedgeswhich were dark as yew except for the yellowgreen tips of new growth mrs colbert visited all the flowerbeds the lilac arbour was now in bud the yellow roses would soon be opening the mistress sent tap for her shears and cut off sprays from the mockorange bushes which were filling the air with fragrance with these in her lap she moved on until she was carried into old jezebels cabin and her chair put down beside the bed you know who it is dont you aunt jezebel cose i does miss sapphy aint i knowed you since de day you was bawn the old woman turned on her side to see her mistress better she had wasted since sapphira saw her last as she lay curled up in bed she looked very like a lean old grey monkey she had been a tall strapping woman her grizzled wool was twisted up in bits of rag she was toothless and her black skin had taken on a greyish cast jezebel thought she was about ninetyfive she knew she was eighteen when she was captured and sold to a british slaver but she was not sure how many years passed before she learned english and began to keep account of time mrs colbert put the sprays of syringa down on the pillow close to the old womans face the mockoranges are out i thought youd like to smell them theres not a man on the place can tend the shrubs like you did thank ee mam i hepped you set out most all de shrubs on dis place didn i wasnt nothin when we first come here but dat ole white lilack tree those were good times auntie ive been housebound for a long while now like you oh missy caint dem doctors in winchester do nothin fur you whats dey good fur anyways she broke off with a wheeze there now you mustnt talk it catches your breath we must take what comes to us and be resigned yesm ise resigned the old woman whispered mrs colbert went on soothingly when i sit out on the porch on a day like this and look around i often think how we used to get up early and rake over the new flowerbeds and transplant before it got hot and you used to run down to the creek and break off alder branches and wed stick them all around the plants wed set out to keep the sun off i expect you remember those things too the old negress looked up at her and nodded now im going to read you a psalm that will hearten us both mrs colbert took from her reticule her glassescase and a prayer book but she opened neither as she repeated the lord is my shepherd jezebel watched her intently her eyes shining bright under eyelids thin as paper when the mistress finished the psalm she called for nancy who was waiting in the cabin kitchen in case she might be needed are the boys outside then she turned again to the bed have you quilts enough jezebel do they keep you warm yes missy the niggahs is mighty good to me dey keeps a flatiron to my feet an a bag a hot salt undah my

strength dont want nothin missy cant you think of anything that would taste good to you now think a minute and tell me isnt there something the old woman gave a sly chuckle one paper eyelid winked and her eyes gave out a flash of grim humour nom i caint think of nothin i could relish lessen maybe it was a lil pickaninnys hand nancy crouching in a corner broke out with a startled cry and ran to the foot of the bed oh shes awanderin agin she wanders turrible now dont stay missy shes out of her haid mrs colbert raised her eyes and gave the girl a cold steady look no need for you to be speaking up i know your granny through and through she is no more out of her head than i am she turned back again to the bed took up jezebels cold grey claw and patted it goodbye till another time auntie now you must turn over and have a nap she beckoned to the four hands standing outside and they came with their hickory poles and carried her away ii jezebel was the only one of the colbert negroes who had come from africa all the others were as they proudly said virginians born and raised on the dodderidge place or on the estates of their loudoun county neighbours but jezebel was brought over from guinea that gold coast of the slavetraders in the seventeen eightiesabout twenty years before the importation of slaves became illegal she was sold to her first master on the deck of a british slaver in the port of baltimore her native village in africa lay well inland some four days journey from the sea it was raided and destroyed by a coast tribe which early in the history of the traffic had become slavehunters for the slavers that night of fire and slaughter when she saw her father brained and her four brothers cut down as they fought old jezebel now remembered but dimly it was all over in a few hours of the village nothing was left but smoking ashes and mutilated bodies by morning she and her fellow captives were in leg chains and on their march to the sea when they reached the coast they were kept in the stockade only long enough to be stripped shaved all over the body and drenched with sea water an english vessel the albert horn lay at anchor out in the gulf with nearly a full cargo of negroes stowed on board the wind was good and the skipper was waiting impatiently for the booty of this last raid jezebel and the other captives were rowed out in small boats and put on board in leg chains they came from a fierce cannibal people and had not been broken in by weeks of discipline in the stockade when the albert horn was under sail and the blue lines of the inland mountains began to grow dim the fetters were taken off the female captives they were not likely to make trouble the albert horn built for the slave trade had two decks the negroes were stowed between the upper and lower decks on a platform as long and as wide as the vessel but there was only three feet ten inches between the shelf on which they lay and the upper deck which roofed them over the slaves made the long voyage of from two to three months in a sitting or recumbent position on a plank floor with very little space if any between their bare bodies the males were stowed forward of the main hatch the women aft all were kept naked throughout the voyage and their heads and bodies were shaved every fortnight as there was no drainage of any sort the slaves quarters and the creatures in them got very foul overnight every morning the tween decks and its inmates were cleaned off with streams of sea water from the hose the captain of the albert horn was not a brutal man and his vessel was a model slaver except in rough weather the males ironed two and two were allowed out on the lower deck for a few hours while their platform was being scrubbed and fumigated at the same time the women were turned out on the lower after deck without chains on the first night after the albert horn got under way the sailors gave jezebel the name she had borne ever since when the two hands detailed to watch the after tween decks had seen that all the females were lying in the spaces assigned to them they put out their lanterns and went on deck to take the air a little later the second mate hearing shrieks and screams from the womens quarters ran down from his cabin to find the guards flogging a girl they had dragged out from a heap of rolling howling blacks its this here jezebel made all the row sir one of the men panted the mate made a dash and drove at her throat to throttle her but she was too quick for him she snapped like a mastiff and bit through the ball of his thumb next morning the mate felt an ominous throbbing in his hand he reported the fracas to the captain saying he didnt see anything for it but to throw the female gorilla overboard she could never be tamed the skipper feared his mate might be in for a bad infection but he had a third interest in the cargo and he wasnt anxious to throw any of it overboard he thought he would like to see a girl who could stand up against two men and the cat clean her off and put a bridle on her and bring her up he told the mate himself he never went near the slave deck he couldnt stand the smell jezebel was brought up in heavy irons for his inspection her naked back was seamed with welts and bloody cuts but she carried herself with proud indifference and there was no plea for mercy in her eyes the skipper told the seamen in charge to loosen the noose round her neck as he walked up and down smoking his pipe he looked her well over he judged this girl was worth any three of the womenas much as the best of the men anatomically she was remarkable for an african negress tall straight muscular long in the legs the skipper had a kind of respect for a well shaped creature horse cow or woman and he respected anybody who could take a flogging like that without buckling he gave orders that jezebel was not to go back between decks she was to be kept on the upper deck in all weathers fastened with a light chain to the deck rail she was to be given a sailors jacket to cover her wounds and at night she was to be provided with a tarpaulin after she was thus isolated the girl gave no more troublethough she always laughed aloud when the second mate passed with his arm in a sling the voyage was long and rough jezebel was knocked about and drenched by heavy seas and was sometimes seasick but she made no complaint when the seamen hosed out the scupper she took off her jacket and invited the stream of salt water over her body except for a few long scars on her back and thighs there was nothing now to show what had happened the first night she came on board when the albert horn at last reached baltimore her skipper kept her out at anchor until buyers from maryland and virginia could be notified and arrive jezebel he noticed regarded the water line of the city with lively curiosity quite different from the hopeless indifference on the faces of her fellow captives shell make the best sale of the lot he told the mate in the first boatload of purchasers who came out to inspect the skippers cargo there was a dutch dairy farmer he brought with him the country doctor of his neighbourhood the dairyman and his friend the doctor were in no hurry they looked over a great number of negroes to jezebel they gave a searching physical examination talking together in the low dutch vernacular and asking no questions of the skipper the dairyman called attention to the whip scars on her body and beckoned the second mate disposition he asked the niggers who captured her did that she put up a fight strong as an ox the dutchman himself looked very like an ox but the doctor looked kind and shrewd he fumbled in his pocket and brought out a deerskin pouch from which he took two squares of maple sugar one he put in his own mouth and smacked his lips the other he offered to jezebel with a questioning smile she opened her jaws at this the second mate standing by looked the other way the doctor put the sugar on jezebels tongue she crunched it grinned and stuck out her tongue for more the doctor gave his friend the deciding nod the dutchman paid the skippers price took jezebel into baltimore and stowed her in the heavy wagon in which he had come to town when he reached home he set about breaking in his new wench on the journey from baltimore he had discovered that her personal manners were too strong for even a dutch farmers household so he lodged her in the haymow over the cow barn she learned to milk the cows and to do all the stable work but she was kept in the barn and was never allowed to touch the butter the dairy farmer died in an outbreak of smallpox his widow promptly sold jezebel she had been owned by several masters and had learned some english before the dodderidge farm steward bought her she went to the dodderidges the year that sapphira was born and had been in the family ever since until jezebel was eighty years old sapphira had entrusted her to oversee the gardens at the mill farm as late as last spring she still got out to sit in the sun and watch the boys who did the shrubbery and shaped the hedges in wintertime she stayed in her cabin sewed carpetrags and patched the farmhands shirts and breeches she meted out justice by giving a slack boy a rough seat in his breeches and a likely boy a smooth seat when manuel since dead had come to her whining that his pants wasnt comfable she gave him a scornful look and said you aint no call to be comfable you settin down de minute a bodys backs turned i wisht i could put dock burs in yo pants iii one morning in april mrs blake arrived at the mill house very early she had been sent for soon after daybreak she found her mother in the diningroom awaiting her well rachel its come at last they tell me she went very quietly i want you to go through the linenpress and take what is needed open the green chest in the garret and find one of the embroidered nightgowns i used to wear when i was a girl theyll be big enough for poor jezebel now if theyre yellow with lying so long nancy can bleach one with alum and hang it in the sun will saturday be soon enough for the funeral the weathers not too warm her daughter agreed it was not mrs colbert motioned to the old man standing behind her chair washington tell lizzie to come here in a few moments lizzie appeared having slipped on a clean apron and rubbed her face vigorously with the masters rumpled breakfast napkin she was barefoot as usual and was struggling to swallow a last mouthful of battercake no matter at what hour she was sent for she was sure to be swallowing a last mouthful of something yes miss sapphy her hands were meekly crossed over her clean apron lizzie i expect you to do me credit this time i wont have any skimping for the watchers as there was when manuel died lizzie stared with astonishment and broke out fervently lawdamighty miss sapphy jest as if id think of bein savin fo ole aunt jezebel it never would cross my thought why dat manuel was jist a nocount young boy missy boy or no boy you put disgrace on me and it was talked about all up and down the creek cold battercakes and ponhos 1 for the watchers who ever heard of such stinginess now remember there will be two nights to cook for you are to boil a ham and fry up plenty of middling meat mrs blake will tell you how many loaves of light bread 2 to bake and there must be plenty of corn bread and sugarcakes and gingercakes master is going to invite all mr lockhearts niggers to come over and sit up and likely some of jezebels grandchildren will come out from winchester 1 scrapple 2 light bread meant bread of wheat flour in distinction from corn bread yes mam lizzie rolled her eyes that shone like blackandwhite china marbles yes mam i sholy will put my bes foot forard fo ole aunt jezebel an all de yeahs she carry but dat triflin lil manuel want no count nohow an his pappy not much bettah mrs colbert held up her plump hand that will do lizzie remember this if you dont do me credit at jezebels wake i will send bluebell back to loudoun county for good as sure as i sit here lizzie put her two hands over her great bosom as if she were taking an oath sending bluebell over to loudoun county meant selling her there and lizzie knew it a few moments later mrs blake passing the kitchen on her way to jezebels cabin heard lizzies malicious giggle she stopped and looked in at the door lizzie was whispering to bluebell who sat drooping over the kitchen table her elbows spread wide apart as she sat day in and day out supposedly helping her mother the colberts like all welltodo families had their own private buryingground it lay in a green field and was enclosed by a wallflat slabs of brown stone laid one upon another with a gate of wrought iron a wide gravelled path divided the square plot in two halves on one side were the family graves with marble headstones on the other side was the slaves graveyard with slate headstones bearing single names dolly thomas manuel and so on the mounds of masters and servants alike were covered with thick mats of myrtle at this season innumerable sprays of new green shoots and starlike paleblue blossoms shot out from the dark creeping vines which clung so close to the earth on saturday afternoon the procession formed to carry jezebel to the end of all her journeyings everyone was in black the family the neighbours from up and down the creek the colbert negroes and the slaves from down in the hayfield country mrs blakes little girls had few dresses of any kind so they were draped in black shawls lent by their grandmother mrs colbert herself wore the black crepe she reserved for funerals she was carried in her chair and the miller in his sunday coat walked beside her they followed immediately behind the coffin which was borne by four of jezebels greatgrandsons come out from winchester while they stood about the grave mr fairhead made a short address he recalled jezebels long wanderings how she had come from a heathen land where people worshipped idols and lived in bloody warfare to become a devout christian and an heir to all the promises perhaps her long old age had been granted her that she might fill out in years the full measure of a christian life after his last prayer lizzie and bluebell sang in the sweet by and by and the company dispersed jefferson and washington as the oldest servants stayed behind with the greatgrandsons to fill up the grave that night there was a big supper in the kitchen for the colbert negroes and all the visitors a first and second sitting at table the darkies were always gay after a funeral and this funeral had pleased everyone miss sapphy sholy give jezebel a beautiful laying away they all agreed washington serving his master and mistress in the big house noticed that they too were more animated than usual expressing their satisfaction that things had gone so well and that jezebels young kinsmen had been able to come and carry her the master sat long at table had two helpings of pudding and drank four cups of tea when at last he rose his wife said persuasively surely you dont mean to go back to the mill tonight henry with your good clothes on yes i think i must i have been away all day i want to speak to those boys from town and give them a little money they will be starting back late tonight good night sapphira i expect you are tired and i hope you sleep well the same to you she said with a placid smile which changed to an expression of annoyance while her eyes followed him to the door as she sat there alone her face grew hard and bitter a few hours ago when she was being carried out of the graveyard after the burial she had seen something which greatly disturbed her behind the dark cedars just outside the stone wall her husband and nancy stood in deep conversation the girl was in an attitude of dejection her head hanging down her hands clasped together and the master whatever he was saying was speaking very earnestly with affectionate solicitude sapphira had put her handkerchief to her eyes afraid that her face might show her indignation never before had she seen him expose himself like that whatever he was pressing upon that girl he was not speaking as master to servant there was nothing to suggest that special sort of kindliness permissible under such circumstances he was not uttering condolences it was personal he had forgotten himself now as she sat at the table opposite his empty chair she felt her anger rising she rang her bell for the old butler washington you may take me to my room send till to me till got mrs colbert into her ruffled nightgown and stood brushing out her heavy hair she felt there was something wrong she began to talk soothingly about the old days at chestnut hill the mistress scarcely heard her as she walked toward her bed on tills arm she paused at the window drew aside the long chintz curtains and looked out toward the mill there was a red patch in the darkness down there the lights in the millers room were burning she let the curtain fall and continued her way to the wide fourpost bed till said goodnight blew out the candles and went away left alone the mistress could not go to sleep her training and her own good sense had schooled her to know that there are very few situations in life worth getting wrought up about but tonight she was angry she was hurtand remorseful because she was hurt her mind kept going back to chestnut hill and her father she wished she had been kinder to him in the years when he was crippled and often in pain she wished she had shown him a little tenderness his eyes used to ask for it sometimes she remembered she had been solicitous and resolutely cheerful kept him up to the mark saw that his body servant neglected nothing but she knew there was something he wanted more than he wanted clean linen every morning or to have his tea just as he liked it she had never given in to him never humoured his weakness in those days she had not known the meaning of illness to be crippled and incapacitated not to come and go at will to be left out of things as if one were in ones dotageshe had no realization of what that felt like none at all invalids were to be kept clean and comfortable greeted cheerily that was their life the longer she lay awake thinking of those things in the far past the more lonely and wretched and injured she felt herself to be tonight her usual fortitude seemed to break up altogether she reached for it but it was not there strange alarms and suspicions began to race through her mind how far could she be deceived and mocked by her own servants in her own house what was the meaning of that intimate conversation which had gone on under her very eyes this afternoon unable to lie still any longer she got cautiously out of bed reaching for her cane and her armchair pushing the chair along beside her she got to the window and again held back the curtain the ruddy square of light still burned in the dark mill she sat down in the chair and reflected hours ago she had heard nancy put her straw tick outside the door but was she there now perhaps she did not always sleep there a substitutethere were four young coloured girls not counting bluebell who might easily take nancys place on that pallet very likely they did take her place and everyone knew it could till even be trusted besides till went early to her cabinshe would be the last to know the mistress sat still scarcely breathing overcome by dread the thought of being befooled hoodwinked in any way was unendurable to her there were candles on her dressingtable but she had no way to light them her throat was dry and seemed closed up she felt afraid to call aloud afraid to take a full breath a faintness was coming over her she put out her hand and resolutely rang her clapper bell the chamber door opened and someone staggered in yes mam yes mam whassa matter missy nancys sleepy startled voice mrs colbert dropped back in her chair and drew a long slow breath it was over her shattered treacherous house stood safe about her again she was in her own room wakened out of a dream of disasterbut she must see it through what she had begun nancy im taken bad run out to the kitchen and blow up the coals and put the kettle on then go for your mother i must get my feet into hot water nancy scurried down the long hall and out to the kitchen she was wide awake now and alarmed she wasnt a girl to hold a grudge till came sooner than her mistress would have thought possible nancy brought the foottub and the big iron teakettle till sat on the floor rhythmically stroking her mistresss swollen ankles and knees murmuring its all right missy they is no worse than common its just a chill you caught waitin out there by the graveside when the mistress was again put to bed till begged to stay with her but mrs colbert comforted by the promptness and sympathy of her servants thanked them both said the pain was gone now and she would sleep better alone as they helped her from her chair she had looked once more from her window the millers lights were still burning in the west room of the mill was the man worrying over some lawsuit he had never told her about she wondered or was he perhaps reading his religious books she knew he pondered at times upon how we are saved or lost that was the disadvantage of having been raised a lutheran in her church all those things had been decided long ago by heads much wiser than henrys she had married the only colbert who had a conscience and she sometimes wished he hadnt quite so much behind the square of candlelight down there the miller in his mill clothes was sitting with his bible open on the table before him but he was no longer reading jezebels life as mr fairhead had summed it up seemed a strange instance of predestination for her certainly her capture had been a deliverance yet he hated the whole system of slavery his father had never owned a slave the quakers who came down from pennsylvania believed that slavery would one day be abolished in the north there were many people who called themselves abolishers henry colbert knew he had a legal right to manumit any of his wifes negroes but that would be an outrage to her feelings and an injustice to the slaves themselves where would they go how would they live they had never learned to take care of themselves or to provide for tomorrow they were a part of the dodderidge property and the dodderidge household of all the negro men on the place sampson his head millhand was the only one who might be able to get work and make a living out in the world he was a tall straight mulatto with a good countenance thoughtful intelligent his head was full behind the ears shaped more like a melon lying down than a peanut standing on end colbert trusted sampsons judgment and believed he could get a place for him among the quaker mills in philadelphia he had considered buying sampson from sapphira and sending him to pennsylvania a free man three years ago he had called sampson into his room one night and proposed this plan to him sampson did not interrupt he stood in his manly responsible way listening intently to his master but when it was his turn to speak he broke down this was his home here he knew everybody he didnt want to go out among strangers besides belle his wife was a slack worker and his children were little he could never keep them in a city as well off as they were here what ever had put such a notion in mister henrys head wasnt he real smart about his work belle he knew wasnt much account to help down at the house but she was good to the chillun an she didnt do no harm anyhow hed amost sooner leave the chillun than leave the mill when theyd got everything fixed up so nice and could bolt finer white flour than you could buy in town i guess id miss you more than youd miss the mill sampson well say no more about it if thats how you feel said the miller rising and putting his hand on sampsons shoulder there it ended sampson never afterward referred to this proposal nor did his master on this night after jezebels burial henry colbert had been reading over certain marked passages in the book he accepted as a complete guide to human life he had turned to all the verses marked with a large s joseph daniel and the prophets had been slaves in foreign lands and had brought good out of their captivity nowhere in his bible had he ever been able to find a clear condemnation of slavery there were injunctions of kindness to slaves mercy and tolerance remember them in bonds as bound with them yes but nowhere did his bible say that there should be no one in bonds no one at alland henry had often asked himself were we not all in bonds if lizzie the cook was in bonds to sapphira was she not almost equally in bonds to lizzie the miller knew the hour must be getting late his big silver watch he had left up at the house on his wifes dressingtable but he and the negroes could tell time by the stars at this season of the year if the big dipper had set under the dark spruceclad hills behind rachels house it would be past midnight he opened his north window and looked out yes the dipper had gone down the air of the soft still spring night came in at the window there was no sound but the creek pouring steadily over its rocky bottom as he stood there he repeated to himself some verses of a favourite hymn god moves in a mysterious way his wonders to perform deep in unfathomable mines of never failing skill he treasures up his bright designs and works his sovereign will we must rest he told himself on our confidence in his design design was clear enough in the stars the seasons in the woods and fields but in human affairs perhaps our bewilderment came from a fault in our perceptions we could never see what was behind the next turn of the road whenever he went to winchester he called upon a wise old quaker this man though now seventy firmly believed that in his own lifetime he would see one of those great designs accomplished that the lord had already chosen his heralds and his captains and a morning would break when all the black slaves would be free book iv sapphiras daughter i one breezy afternoon mrs blake was footing it round the last loop of the double s on her way to timber ridge at the end of the steep grade she sat down on a mossy stump took off her sunbonnet and gave herself up to enjoyment of the spring day in the deep ravine below the road a mountain stream rushed coffee brown throwing up crystal rainbows where it gurgled over rock ledges on the steep hillside across the creek the tall forest trees were still barethe oak leaves no bigger than a squirrels ear from out the naked grey wood the dogwood thrust its crooked forks starred with white blossomsthe flowers set in their own wild way along the rampant zigzag branches their unexpectedness their singular whiteness never loses its wonder even to the dullest dweller in those hills in all the rich flowering and blushing and blooming of a virginia spring the scentless dogwood is the wildest thing and yet the most austere the most unearthly mrs blake was thinking this out to herself as she sat on the stump she gave scarcely a glance at the wild honeysuckle all about her growing low out of the gravelly soil pink and rose colour with long trembling stamens which made each blossom look like a brilliant insect caught in flight when at last she took her basket and travelled upward she left the turnpike and followed a byroad along the crest of the ridge up here the soil was better planted fields and little green meadows lay along her path may apples grew in the damp spots their blossoms like tiny pond lilies gave out a heavy almost sickening sweetness here and there stood a wellbuilt farmhouse with carefully tended yard and garden along the rail fences the locust trees were in bloom the breeze caught their perfume and wafted it down the road every virginian remembers those locusts which grow along the highways their cloudshaped masses of bluegreen foliage and heavy drooping clusters of creamwhite flowers like pea blossoms excepting the very old trees the giants the locusts look yielding and languid like the mountain boy lounging against the counter when he goes to the country store yet from the time they are big enough to cut they make the toughest fence posts a farmer can find and in the timber trade the yellow locust is valued for its resistance to moisture from the ridge road mrs blake could look down over hills and valleys as if she were at the top of the world she liked to go up there at any time of the year and she liked to go on foot and alone even in her best days before her husband died when she lived in washington and never came home to back creek for a visit she used sometimes to be homesick for these mountains and the high places this afternoon she was on the ridge in answer to a sick call but it was not a serious one and she meant to enjoy herself last evening a pale little girl barefoot in a carefully mended dress had slipped silently into mrs blakes kitchen without knocking for all that her hair was braided and her face was washed she was a distressful little creature with dark circles about her eyes there was something at once furtive and innocent in her face she told mrs blake how granny let the flatiron fall on her foot tother day an now her toe was festerin would miz blake maybe come up an see if they ought to send for doctor brush and now mrs blake was on her way to see she had bandages and turpentine ointment and arnica in her basket but she had also a fruit jar full of freshground coffee half a baking of sugar cakes and a loaf of light bread the poor folks on the ridge esteemed coffee and wheat bread great delicacies this visit was not to be entirely wasted on a sore foot indeed mrs blake suspected that the foot was maybe not very bad and that old mrs ringer had sent for her because she had not seen her for a long time and wanted a visit with her mrs blake herself looked forward to this visit mrs ringer was better company than many people who were more fortunate who came of better blood and had farms and raised sheep and pigs for market there were some families on the ridge who were comfortably off owned a few negroes to do the work and held themselves very high if you called at the pembertons for instance you were kept waiting half an hour in the parlour while the ladies dressed and powdered their faces when at last they appeared with their mourningbordered handkerchiefs and jet earrings they minded their manners so carefully that the talk was very dull now mandy ringer had lived a hard life goodness knew but misfortune and drudgery had never broken her spirit she was as thin as a grasshopper and as lively as one she had probably never spent a dull day when she woke in the morning she got into her calico dress in a flash and ran out to see what her garden had done overnight then she took a bucket and went to milk sukey in the shed her son though he was a cripple would have done it for her but in that country it was the custom for the women to do the milking mrs ringer wouldnt have trusted either of her two daughters to take care of sukey that little whitefaced cow kept the log house going when everything else failed and her calves brought in the only actual money the old woman ever saw mrs ringer was born interested she got a great deal of entertainment out of the weather and the behaviour of the moon any chance bit of gossip that came her way was a godsend the rare sight of a strange face was a treat a pedlar with a pack on his back or a medicinevendor come from across the alleghenies with his little cart mrs ringer couldnt read or write as she was frank to tell you but the truth was she could read everything most important the signs of the seasons the meaning of the way the wood creatures behaved and human faces she once said to mrs blake when they were talking things over if the lordll jist let me stay alive mam an not put me down into a dirty hole i kin bear anything she had borne a good deal certainly her son was a poor cripple and both her daughters had been fooled that seldom occurred twice even in the most shiftless households disgrace to the womenfolk brought any family very low in that country but mandy ringer couldnt stay crushed for long she came up like a cork probably with no better excuse than that the sun came up her spirits bubbled into the light like a spring and spread among the cresses rachel blake had always been drawn toward expansive warmhearted people and she had known many such folks in her time when she lived in washington city before her husband died as she turned in at a low log house with a big outside rock chimney mrs ringer her foot done up in rags hopped lightly to the door to greet her now aint you most a angel to come all the way up the hills to see us i declare i had amost give you up but lawndis he tole me not to despair an he would go so fur as to shave fur you at this a brownskinned man with a crooked back and a clubfoot came forward yes miz blake when the wind turned an blowed the clouds away i reckoned youd be along to see mother his voice was mellow and grave and there was true courtesy in the way he looked at the visitor placed a chair for her and relieved her of her basket mrs blake examined the sore foot and declared there was nothing worse than a bad bruise she applied her ointment and a clean bandage and took from her basket a pair of old carpet slippers youll be easy in these mrs ringer put them on and keep them on dont on any account go about barefoot now im a little weary after my walk and if lawndis will kindle a fire im going to make some coffee for us after the son had a fire going he took up his hat if youll excuse me miz blake ill go out in the garden an do some weedin you and motherll feel freer to talk by yourselves she aint seen much compny lately he limped out of the house careful not to put on his hat until he was well outside the door mrs ringer spread a white cloth on the kitchen table and got out her blue chiney cups and plates before the water was boiling lawndis came back with a stone crock in his hands here mother i seem to remember miz blake dont like her coffee without cream if youll skim some off ill take the crock back to the spring house we got a real cold springhouse mam bettern most folks up here its quite a piece away but thats where the spring is your son surely has nice manners mrs ringer remarked mrs blake as she watched him limping across the garden with the milk yesm lawndis is a good boy if i do say it an he gits a power a work done fur a lame man aint it a pity i didnt have no luck with my gals this was a delicate subject mrs blake did not wish to discuss it where are the girls today she asked politely as if there were nothing queer about them ginnie shes got work up at capon springs helpin clean the hotel fur summer visitors up there they aint heered

thats got able men folks to see she gits her rights mrs blake still sought to avoid discussing these misfortunes since there was nothing she could do to remedy them she said blandly well whatever happened i know lawndis would never be hard on his sisters now do tell me mrs ringer who did you name your boy after ive often wondered and never thought to ask you lawndis why after the preacher cant

never heered sich sermons before nor since when the next baby come i called him after that preacher yes mrs blake remembered the preacher he wore a longtailed coat even on horseback and his name was leonidas bright the hill people could do queer things with unfamiliar names at this moment the pale little girl who had come to mrs blakes yesterday stole down the ladder from the loft over the kitchen and shyly approached the table in her hand was a little wooden box full of quartz crystals she had picked up on the stony hillsides is these dimonds miz blake mam kin i sell em fur money no

away an fur all the talk theyve raised it dont amount to much moren pore beckys dimonds there is a kinda justice in this world after all now aint there their talk turned naturally to the classic example of belated justice the murder of the pedlar at the red brick house on the ridge road and its exposure after twenty years while mrs ringer was telling all she remembered of the two wretched women who had killed the pedlar for his pack lawndis appeared at the door sweaty and panting maw im afeered them keysers is got casper i heered trouble over in the woods an bucks big hawhaw hes got

blake well all go they aint no business in our woods mrs blake picked up her basket take one of lawndis canes mandy and spare your foot all you can she set out with the two cripples down the garden past the springhouse and over toward the wood where they heard ugly taunting voices they had not gone far when they came upon the three keysers and their captive a young boy perhaps fifteen or sixteen was stripped naked to the waist and bound tight to a chestnut sapling three men were lounging about the tree making fun of him the brother called buck had his sleeves rolled up and his shirt open showing a thick fleece of red hair on his chest and forearms he was laughing and cracking a lash of plaited cowhide thongs the boy tied to the tree said not a word in answer to bucks taunting questions he made no sound at all did not even look up when mrs blake came swishing through the bushes for all he had set his teeth tight together she could see his lower jaw trembling mrs ringer spoke first now what air you keysers up to big buck had a very smooth way with him when he took the trouble he had certainly not expected to see mrs blake from back creek and her appearance put a different light on things he pulled off his hat and spoke easy nothin but a famly matter folks this young fellers been charged with takin the communion set his maws a keyser an its fur us to settle with him you know yourselves his paws no account an that baptist preacher he goes to school to dont seem to alearned him to keep his hands off things time fur the famly to learn him a little hes got to tell where them things is hid mrs blake had kept a steady eye on buck and now she spoke then youd better go and get em buck keyser and put em back where they belong for theyre poor plated stuff and youll get nothing for them but trouble bucks face didnt change but his two brothers looked at each other thats what im after doin miz blake onct i git em outa him with that he swung his lash and gave casper a cut on the bare shoulder the boy made no sound but poor lawndis was so worked upon that he burst out crying and threw his arms round the prisoner to shield him with his own back dont you dast hit him agin i cant fight ye im jist a pore mock of a man but youll have to finish me afore you tech him mrs blake knew lawndis would be sick for a week after such an outbreak shame on you buck keyser she said going up to him and putting her hand on his hairy arm its lawndis will get the most punishment out of this and you know it what did you come on their place for to act your foolishness what

the house and drink the coffee that was left while the two women untied the flight boy and hunted for his shirt mrs ringer whispered like as not they brought him into our woods a purpose they was feelin devilish an whats the good aactin devilish if nobody sees you they knows lawndis is soft thataway an cant see a sparrer fall its a mercy you was here miz blake i reckon they dont want to git in too bad with your paw on her way down the double s and the holler road mrs blake told herself she must have a talk with david fairhead about casper perhaps it wasnt wise to encourage him i dont know whether that boys strong enough to master whats around him she said to herself a mans got to be strongern a bull to get out of the place he was born in i just hope i wont dream tonight the way casper stood against that tree with his lower jaw tremblin ii to see mrs blake working about her house and garden a stranger would scarcely guess that she had lived the happiest years of her life in washington and had known a wider experience of the world than her more worldly mother rachel was sixteen years old when michael blake rode through frederick county soliciting votes he was already a member of the virginia state legislature and was a nominee for the united states congress he spent some days at the mill farm where he was warmly welcomed henry colbert approved of blakes record and his principles and the mistress was charmed by his good manners his handsome face and blue eyes when he said goodbye and rode up into the capon river country she missed him in two weeks he came back to the mill farm he had made up his mind he had made it up indeed on his first visit but he had disclosed his intentions to no one not even to rachel when on this second visit he asked the miller and sapphira for their daughters hand they were speechless from astonishment after the interview in which they gave their consent mrs colbert retired to her room and bolted the door for an hour to regain her composure she had never hoped for anything so good for rachel she had often doubted whether she would succeed in getting her married at all two older daughters she had married very well but she could see nothing in this girl likely to be attractive to young men rachel was wellenough looking in her fathers masterful way but no one could call her pretty she was reserved to a degree which her mother called sullenness and she had decided opinions on matters which did not concern women at all she was her fathers favourite that was natural since she was just like him but this happy faircomplexioned young blake with his warm laugh and mellow voice well mrs colbert reflected there is no accounting for tastes blake was irish and the irish often leap before they look when she had recovered herself mrs colbert sat down to write the amazing news to her sisters while she was at her desk the young man was with rachel he had found her in the flower garden separating tufts of clove pinks he wiped her hands on his handkerchief and led her into the lilac arbour seated beside her on the rustic bench he told her his story in the manner of the period on the first night of his first visit he said when he sat opposite her at the supper table it all happened he had watched her face in the candlelight and found it hard to reply to her mothers friendly questions or to keep his mind on the conversation he had stayed on at the house until he was afraid he might wear out his welcome after he rode away he could think of nothing but rachel whenever he was alone he was thirty years old and had never before met a girl whom he wished to marry indeed he admitted he liked his liberty now everything was different her father and mother had given their consent but he must have her own spoken from the heart do you think you could come to love me really love me rachel his voice was wistful almost sad she looked up and met his blue eyes fearlessly something intense flashed into her own i do already michael my sweetheart may i have one kiss she put her hands on his shoulders holding him back and with that almost fierce devotion still shining in her eyes said pleadingly please michael please not until the words have been said no reply could have made him happier he caught her two hands and buried his face in them this was in the eighteenthirties when loose manners were very loose and the proprieties correspondingly strict young bachelors who were free in their morals were very exacting that the girl they chose for a wife should be virginal in mind as well as in body the worst that could be said of an unmarried girl was that she knew too much immediately after michaels election as representative for the th district the young couple were married and went to washington to live in a small rented house the devotion michael read in rachels eyes when she refused him the betrothal kiss soon became her whole life there was nothing of her left outside it in every sense he was her first love more than that he had taken her from a home where she had never been happy she felt for him all that was due to a rescuer and a saviour until he came her heart was cold and frozen when rachel was twelve years old she had chanced to overhear a conversation which coloured her thoughts and feelings ever afterward in those days she used often to walk to the post office to get the mail although she knew this annoyed her mother rachel was deeply attached to the postmistress then a young woman who had lately been left a widow with three little boys one morning she was sitting on mrs bywaterss shady front porch behind the blooming honeysuckle vines when she saw a handsome old gentleman ride up to the hitchpost dismount and tie his horse that was mr cartmell mrs bywaterss father as he walked up the gravel path to the porch steps his daughter saw him and came out to greet him they went into the house together leaving the door open behind them rachel liked to listen to mr cartmell his talk had a flavour of oldfashioned courtesy i came with something on my mind today daughter he began your mother and i think you have it too hard up here since jonah went what with looking after the mail and attending to your children and the housework there is too much for one woman to do our old neighbour mr longfield tells me he is willing to part with one of abigails daughters but he would never sell her off to strangers in busy seasons your mother often hires her from the longfields and finds her capable and willing i would like to buy mandy for you and bring her up here myself you would have a smart girl to help you and she would have a good home there was a pause then mrs bywaters said could we hire mandy from the longfields for a couple years maybe i made such a proposal to mr longfield but he needs a considerable sum of money at once he is forced to sell mose his body servant into winchester you will remember our neighbour was somewhat inclined to extravagance he has got behind another pause you have never owned any slaves yourself father she said thoughtfully as if considering you know my feeling on that matter caroline but down with us in the round hill neighbourhood it is always easy to hire help from farmers who have too many negroes up here there are few slaveowners and a raw white girl from the mountains would be of little help to you this time there was no pause mrs bywaters spoke quietly but firmly its kindly thought of you father and kindly spoken but neither you nor i have ever owned flesh and blood and i will not begin it i am young and strong and ill make shift to manage peace of mind is what i value most little rachel colbert sitting breathless on the porch heard mr cartmell rise from his squeaky splintbottom chair and say you are my own daughter caroline we will manage the deep emotion in his voice and the hush which followed made rachel realize that she had been eavesdropping listening to talk that was private and personal she fled swiftly through the yard and out to the road her feet must have found the way home for she gave no heed to where she was going a feeling long smothered had blazed up in herhad become a conviction she had never heard the thing said before never put into words it was the owning that was wrong the relation itself no matter how convenient or agreeable it might be for master or servant she had always known it was wrong it was the thing that made her unhappy at home and came between her and her mother how she hated her mothers voice in sarcastic reprimand to the servants and she hated it in contemptuous indulgence till and aunt jezebel were the only blacks to whom her mother never spoke with that scornful leniency after that morning on mrs bywaterss porch rachel was more than ever reserved and shut within herself her two aunts disapproved of her she dreaded the yearly visit to them at home she knew that all the servants were fond of her mother in good or ill humour and that they were not fond of her she was not at all what the darkies thought a young lady should be tills good manners were barely sufficient to conceal her disappointment in miss sapphys youngest daughter michael blake had dropped from the clouds as it were to deliver rachel from her loneliness from life in a home where she had not a single confidant she often wondered how she had borne that life at all once settled in the narrow rented house on r street she no longer brooded upon real or imagined injustices her mind and energy and she was endowed with both were wholly given to making for michael the kind of home he wanted and doing it on very little money representative blake was he admitted fond of the pleasures of the table rachel became expert in cookery everything he liked done as he liked appeared in season on his dinner table he lunched at an oyster bar near the capitol and dined at eight in the evening his wife had the whole day to prepare his favourite dishes she put herself under the instruction of a free mulatto woman from new orleans whose master had manumitted her when he was dying in washington sarah now made her living by cooking for dinner parties every morning on his way to the capitol michael stopped at the big market and sent home the choicest food of the season in those days the washington markets were second to none in the world for fish and game wild ducks partridges pheasants wild turkeys the woods were full of wildfowl the uncontaminated bays and rivers swarmed with fish potomac shad baltimore oysters shrimps scallops lobsters and terrapin in the spring the dutch truck gardeners brought in the first salads and asparagus and strawberries a group of louisiana planters who came to washington every winter kept michaels cellar supplied with good wines these southerners often dined at the blakes grateful for an escape from the bleakness of washington hotels they usually brought with them a young french officer who had some humble post at the french legation too poor to marry chenier lived wretchedly in a boardinghouse his devotion to mrs blake and her good dinners became a positive embarrassment the subject of many a jest at michaels breakfast table the planters came up to washington unaccompanied by their families at the round dinner table in the blakes narrow diningroom would be seated five or six men never more than seven in broadcloth and shining linen the louisianians wore frilled shirts with diamond studs the officer his shabby dress uniform there was no place set for a woman not even for the hostess the hostess was below stairs in the brickfloored basement kitchen her companions were the glowing coal range a sink with a hydrant pump shelves of copper cooking vessels and an adjacent cold pantry full of food and drink there she achieved a dinner for epicures with no help but sarah the mulatto who also served in the diningroom at the end of the dinner when the dessert had been carried up by the stately mulatto then there was a call for the hostess slipping off her long white apron and dashing a little powder over her face rachel went upstairs to drink a glass of champagne with the guests if she did not appear soon after the dessert the young frenchman ran down to the kitchen and brought her up on his arm her husband and his friends rose to toast her hot and flushed as she was their faces by this time were quite as rosy and to their slightly contracted pupils the young woman who had given them such a dinner was beautiful rachel enjoyed the iced wine and the warm praiseand she enjoyed the gaiety for after she joined the party it became distinctly gayer however lively it had been before she sat in michaels chair and he stood behind her filled her glass and coaxed her to eat his dessert beaming with his pride in her after the first glass she did not feel tired her responsibilities over she relaxed and leaned back in michaels big chair laughing at the funny storiesher fathers deep laugh she begged them to sing for her little brown jug and auld lang syne like many persons of a serious temper she loved being with people who were easily and carelessly merry in due time the children came along first a son robert the well beloved a second boy died in infancy then came the two girls mary and betty during those happy years rachel had but one anxiety her husbands extravagant tastes and his carelessness about keeping the tradesmen paid up michael reassured her as to the future he carried what he termed a heavy life insurance used to show her the premium cheques before he sent them off in the months before a new baby came there was no entertaining and rachel was able to cut the household expensesthough michael largely defeated her thrift by bringing her presents even in those years there was something of the devotee in rachel the will to selfabnegation which showed itself later was in her then though it took the form of untiring service to a mans pleasure and of almost idolatrous love for her firstborn perhaps she was conscious of a certain chill in her own nature and was afraid of being insufficient to her pleasureloving husband his rich enjoyment of life had an irresistible charm for her rachel had been married thirteen years when michael thought he could afford to accept the longpressed invitation of his southern friends to visit them in new orleans he persuaded his wife to let him take the boy along with him robert was then eleven handsome and gay like his father rachel knew the trip would be a fine experience for him she ought not to hold him back she went to baltimore to see them sail when the last whistle blew and the steamboat began to move out into the bay she could see michael standing in the stern and beside him the boy waving his new scotch cap with ribands letters came often those from robbie were especially cherished the date of their return was fixed but they did not come by the boat on which rachel expected them there was something in the newspapers about an epidemic down there but it was immediately denied after mrs blake had waited through an anxious fortnight a visitor knocked at her doorone of the old new orleans friends who had come up to washington to tell her what he could not write only the day before michael was to start for home the boy fell ill his father who never left him for a moment would not believe it was yellow fever until the child began to vomit black blood fortyeight hours afterward michael blake himself died of the contagion they were both buried in the protestant cemetery in new orleans henry colbert first learned of his soninlaws death from a paragraph in the baltimore sunthe paper was already a week old he went at once to winchester and took the train for washington he found rachel in her bed the daylight shut out her door locked she had refused to admit her doctor and michaels lawyer sarah the mulatto woman had come to stay in the house and was taking care of the two children the miller put his shoulder under the wheel michaels life insurance policy had lapsed the last two premiums had not been paid there was little left for the widow but her furniture and a few debts blakes friends made up a generous purse for her henry colbert paid off the creditors and brought rachel and her children home to back creek they stayed at the mill farm while mr whitford built the house by the road in which mrs blake had lived ever since during the months when the house was abuilding the miller and his wife grew very fond of mary and betty mrs colberts relations with her daughter were pleasanter than they had ever been before to be sure there were things in the past which she could not forget gravest of them was that rachel had not once invited her mother then not an invalid but a very active woman to come to washington to visit her among virginians such a slight could never be forgiven that mrs blakes city house was small and cramped was no excuse your near kin were expected to entertain you even though they had to sleep on cots in the hall and give you their sleepingchamber to be in washington visitors would cheerfully put up with any discomfort that your own daughter lived there and you did not visit her required explanation to your relatives and friends when rachel came back to the mill farm widowed and poor her mother found it easier to overlook past differences than she would have done a few years before mrs colberts illness had not yet come upon her but she had had warnings already she had given over horseback riding though women of that time often kept to the saddle when they were well in their seventies during the six years that had gone by since mrs blakes return the back creek people had grown used to seeing her come and go along the roads and mountain paths on her way to some house where misfortune had preceded her if a neighbour unable to restrain curiosity asked any question about how people lived in washington she replied simply i hardly remember all that is gone id take it kindly of you not to bring it back to me this is my home now and i want to live here like i had never gone away the postmistress whom she had so loved as a child was the only neighbour with whom she ever talked freely they were drawn together by deep convictions they had in common mrs bywaters though she was poor subscribed for the new york tribune since she was in government employ this was an indiscreet thing to do even her father mr cartmell thought it unwise the papers came to her heavily wrapped and addressed in ink she kept them locked in her upper bureau drawer and often gave mrs blake interesting numbers to carry home in her basket they were handy to start a fire with she said book v martin colbert i on the first day of june the romney stage more than an hour late crossed back creek and stopped before the tollgate a girl with a broad flat goodnatured face came out to lift the rickety gate and collect the toll the driver leaned down from his high seat to pass the time of day with her this courtesy he never omitted no matter how much he was behind in his schedule while the driver was chatting one of his five passengers jumped out at the rear end of the stage a young man well dressed and goodlooking he walked forward and interrupted i say driver isnt that turnoff the road to the mill shorely is sir then ill walk over from here take my trunk on to the post office please and leave it my uncle will send for it your uncle yes mr colbert at the mill so thats how it is youre a colbert the driver shifted his tobacco to the other cheek which on em is your paw jacob im martin colbert is that so he looked the young man over with interest ever been out here before yes when i was a youngster good day driver dont forget to put my trunk off the young man saw no reason for tarrying there was no one in sight but the tollgirl noticeable only for her flat red face martin lifted his hat to her however and set off down the stony byroad before the stage started the driver leaned over to say to the girl the miller wont be none too tickled to see him i reckon feller must a got into some scrape agin or he wouldnt be comin out here with a trunk too hes a turrible wild one the stage rattled on toward the post office where it was to change horses the flatfaced girl turned and went slowly down the mill road after the stranger peering to right and left but he was already hidden from sight by the tall sassafras bushes which grew thick all along the rail fence young colbert walked along carelessly finding exercise agreeable after the jolting of the stage sometimes he hummed a tune sometimes he chuckled and ducked his shoulders he was amused to find himself actually on his way to the mill house one of the dreariest spots in all virginia he reckoned the jokes on me his giggle seemed to say just now he was lucky to have any place to go where he would be comfortable and well fed and rid of his creditors he was a tall wellenough built fellow but there was something soft about the lines of his body he carried himself loosely at the shoulders and thighs his clothes were town clothes but strolling along unobserved he behaved like a country boy when he laughed at his present predicament he hitched up his trousers by his gallowses where his waistcoat hung open he was easily diverted no fixed purpose lurked behind his chuckle though there was sometimes a flash of slyness in his whiskycoloured eyes he stopped to watch a mudturtle waddle across the road and rolled the old fellow over on his back to see him kickthen relented and turned him right side up when he got near the mill martin buttoned his waistcoat wiped the dust from his face and straightened his shoulders he did not stop at the mill but went directly on to the house till met him at the front door with genuine cordiality restrained by correctness the mistress is waiting for you in the parlour mr martin we expected you before this sorry till the stage was late starting had to wait for passengers from martinsburg all the folks well here theyre all as usual sir she opened the door into the parlour where mrs colbert was sitting near the fireplace now closed by a painted fireboard she smiled graciously and held out her hand martin hurried across the room and gallantly kissed her on the cheek she shook her finger at him youve kept me waiting for you a long while martin you were certainly in no hurry to make me a visit i first wrote you before easter and here we are coming into june its been a right busy time on the place aunt sapphy he was still standing beside her chair she reached out and felt his palm i dont find any calluses he laughed gaily oh we have plenty of fieldhandstoo many washington came in with the teatray and put it on the table beside the mistress the visitor drew up a chair and sat down opposite his aunt crossing his legs and falling into an attitude of easy indolence which diverted her she liked a dash of impudence in young men whom she considered attractive and martin she was thinking was the best favoured of the younger colberts just then she happened to notice that his boots were very dusty why martin didnt you ride your mare out no maam i came on the stage and walked over from the tollgate the stage you must have been very uncomfortable why didnt you ride merrylegs and send your box by the stage its a pleasant ride i sold merrylegs this spring had a good offer and needed the money while he helped himself to sandwiches she studied his face are you sure you sold her mart she asked shrewdly he had not expected this question he gave her a quick glance and ducked his head with a grin which seemed to say youve caught me now well anyhow i parted with her aunt sapphy cards ill be bound no honour bright it was a racing bet im not much of a card man but i lose my head at the races he looked at her frankly holding out his teacup with an if you please easy confidential a trifle free in manner as if she were not an old woman and an invalid that was how she liked it she told herself that martins visit would be very refreshing she almost believed she had urged him to come solely because she liked to have young people about no matter we can let you have a mount henry keeps a good riding horse to go in to winchester on business he doesnt like to be bothered with the carriage i always preferred to go on horseback when i went to town for sunday service you pretty nearly lived on horseback didnt you oh down with us they still tell about how you used to take the fences yes i liked riding but i never gave myself over body and soul to horses as the bushwells appear to do thats right they just live for the stables the house and grounds would shock you now people say they used to keep the place up as long as you went to visit there but chestnut hill has never been the same since old matchem died till appeared at the door and said that martins box had come mrs colbert beckoned her call nancy to take mr martin up to his room and unpack his things for him she keeps your uncles room at the mill martin and she will do yours and look after your laundry young men are none too orderly i seem to remember now i will rest for an hour before supper martin went up the wide staircase leading from the long hall upstairs he saw an open door and a young mulatto girl standing at attention outside and are you nancy good evening nancy i hear you are going to take care of me he stood still and looked hard at her a wave of pink went over her goldcoloured cheeks and her eyes fell if i can please you sir she said quietly waiting for him to enter the chamber oh you do please me he laughed going into the room martin glanced about large airy not too much furniture canopy bed with fresh muslin curtains he opened one of the front windows and looked out over the yard the mill the woods across the creek beyond the woods the blue wavy slopes of the north mountain lay against the sky the upper porch ran along outside the room he put one leg out through the open window am i allowed to go on the veranda girl very strict rules in this house ive heard tell certainly sir theres a door in the hall goes out to the upper porch she said quickly correcting an implied reproach on the house martin drew in his foot that will be more convenient and now you can unpack my trunk its locked sir lordy i forgot his soleleather trunk had been placed on a chair he unlocked it and threw back the lid there now you put my clothes where you think they ought to go and ill watch you so ill know where to find them he pulled off his coat and waistcoat threw them on the bed and sat down in the usual guest chamber rockingchair nancy took the discarded upper garments and hung them in the clothespress she opened the bureau drawers and stood timidly hesitating before the trunk would you like your collars an neckcloths kept in the upper drawer sir he was just lighting a cigar follow your own notion we have a slut of a housekeeper at home i never know where to find anything she went noiselessly to work moving back and forth between the bureau and the press young colbert sat with his feet on the low window sill enjoying his cigar does my aunt object to smoking he asked presently oh no sir she likes to have the genlemen smoke after putting away the shirts and nightshirts nancy lifted the top tray and stood perplexed by the confusion she found below if you dont mind sir ill take the coats an pants downstairs direcly an press em thats a good idea the shoes and boots she found stuffed full of dirty socks and soiled underwear she made a bundle of the rumpled linen and put it outside the door she was embarrassed because the guest watched her so closely anybody ever tell you youre a damned pretty girl nancy she heard as she stooped over the trunk no sir martin would have done better to change his tone but he did not see her face and went on teasingly you tryin to make me believe none of these country jakes around here been makin up to you you cant fool me theres good kind folks on back creek mr martin you dont say honey martin laughed stretching his loose shoulders nancy didnt like his laugh not at all she took up an armful of coats and trousers snatched the pile of soiled linen outside the door and vanished so quickly that when the young man turned from throwing his cigar end out of the window he was amazed to find her gone ii mrs colbert had zack sent down to the mill to ask her husband to come up early before suppertime when his wife told him that his nephew had come to visit them he showed neither pleasure nor annoyance hospitality in those days was one of the decencies of life whoever came friend or stranger was made welcome and cared for according to his place in the world henry saw that his wife was wearing her velvet gown so he unquestioningly changed his shirt and put on his black suit when martin came downstairs his uncle met him in the spacious hall gave him a hearty handshake and told him he was glad to see him washington announced supper and wheeled the mistress to her place at table the miller noticed that a bottle of his best madeira was on the sideboard as soon as the two men were seated washington filled the wineglasses martin lifted his saying to the lady of the house uncle henry bowing to his aunt who smiled graciously his uncle also smiled supper was served at seven oclock in summer and throughout the hour sampsons twelveyearold katie barefoot in a stiffly starched red calico dress walked round and round the table waving a long flybrush made of a peacocks tail even in town houses the flybrush was part of the table service katie had seldom heard such animated conversation at supper mrs colbert had reserved all her inquiries about loudoun county families until her husband should be present she wished martin to make a good impression he was full of gossip and told a story well he complimented his uncle on his wine and drank it liberally the abstemious miller drank two glasses and left the third standing full his wife who always had a little wine with her supper signalled washington to bring on another bottle martins stories were never quite indecent and always characteristic of old loudoun county neighbours when he was talking about captain bushwells fine horses he happened to say fact is his trainers say nowadays bushwell sleeps in the stables suddenly remembering that the miller was said to sleep at the mill he caught himself up with a giggle blushed and ducked his shoulders sapphira promptly covered his blush by asking him about hal gogarty a daredevil young irishman whose stables rivalled bushwells gogarty course you know about his runaway last summer runaway i didnt know he ever had one its funny sister bushwell didnt tell me about it when i saw her in town at easter gogarty she knew delighted in driving a coachandfour over the roughest roads in the blue ridge mountains people down there took more interest in horses than in anything else martin said gogarty had a party of visitors up from the tidewater country loudoun county people were thought to be a little jealous of the older and richer families in tidewater virginia gogarty had wanted to give his guests a little excitement since they made it plain that in staying with him they were tasting frontier life he arranged to take them on a coaching party and asked martin to go along and sit on the box with him whispering that he meant to make it a pretty rough trip they set out with six passengers that drive martin went on took in some of the worst roads in the mountains uncle henry and you know the best are none too good nobody can handle four horses better than gogarty we went like the wind up hill and down dale the women laughed and screamed but hal never let on he heard them hed have come out all right too except for a funny thing just as we were coming down a long hill at a pretty good pace a young deer jumped out of the bushes right in front of the horses of course they reared and shied hal kept his head nothing got tangled but the right front wheel smashed on a big rock beside the road he couldnt stop the horses on the minute so we bumped along on a dished wheel till the spokes flew out and we turned over then the horses went plumb crazy hal held on to the lines and sawed the bits while i got forward and cut the traces i thought id be kicked to death and i did get a bad shin plaster our passengers were pretty well bumped up but nobody was much hurt one girl got her nose broken she was a pretty girl too i was mighty sorry so was hal it was that damnfool deer made all the mischief who ever heard of a deer acting so martin looked from his uncle to his aunt certainly no one his aunt replied with a twinkle it must have been got up on hals account those folks from the tidewater do hold their heads high though ive never seen just why they feel called upon the miller had laughed at the story but he looked at his wife not his nephew martins laugh showed an upper front tooth of a bluish cast it was set on a wooden pivot and did not fit his gum snugly there was a story about this tooth and the miller did not like to be reminded of it martin on his way to and from the hunts over in clarke county had found a pretty homespun girl in the blue ridge she used to meet him in the woods and as the mountain folk put it he fooled her her two brothers lay for him in the thickets along the road to give him a horsewhipping when they jumped out from cover and caught his mare by the bit he saw he was in for it youre in the right boys he said amiably but no whip come at me with your fists an ill do the best i can one against two thats fair enough they took him at his word and did him in completely they put their mark on him by knocking out one of his white teeth white teeth were not common in that tobaccochewing country the brothers left him unconscious beside the road but they let his horse go home to give the alarm everyone in the blue ridge country and in winchester knew the story of martins blue tooth many of them agreed with sapphira that martin deserved what he got but that spirited young men were wild and always would be sampsons katie walking round and round the supper table with her flybrush wondered what had come over her folks jist alaffin an alaffin she was so delighted so distracted that more than once she let her peacock feathers dip on miss sapphys high headdress even the master laughed at the stories about his old neighbours a deep laugh from the belly up it did a body good to hear it the mistresss laugh was always pleasant when she was not laughing scornfully as a form of reprimand tinkling ladylike but with something cordially appreciative like the occasional flash in her eyes martins laugh was just on the edge of being vulgarrather loose caughtintheact as it were old washington standing behind his mistresss chair reflected that this was a pretty figger of a young man but he wasnt a fullgrowed genleman yet katie excited as she was by the talk had even keener joys in anticipation her eyes gloated over the good things mr washington carried in to the table she knew she would get a taste of them though bluebell always had the best of what went back to the kitchen lizzie had promised to make ice cream enough for everybody tap had brought squares and chunks of ice in a wheelbarrow up from the icehousea dark sawdust filled cave under one wing of the mill since six oclock old jeff had been seated behind the laundry cabin turning the big freezer in winter whenever there was a snowfall lizzie made snowcream for the mistressbeating the fresh clean snow into a bowl of thick cream well flavoured with sugar and brandy but she made ice cream only on special occasions the family sat so long at table that the aftersupper visit in the parlour was brief that night the mistress admitted that she was tired i seldom spend such a lively day martin i had a long wait for my guest and a very pleasant tea and supper after he got here i like having young people with me she added patting his hand she rang for washington and told him to send nancy upstairs to turn down mr martins bed and see that he had everything to make him comfortable when martin went to his room nancy had already taken off the starched pillow shams and was folding up the counterpane do you like the bolster left on sir or jest the pillows just the pillows never leave the bolster on take it away with you cant you yes indeed sir is two candles enough for you good night mr martin as she was going toward the door with the long bolster upright in her arms martin caught her round the shoulders and kissed her on the mouth she let the heavy roll of feathers slide to the floor and pushed against his chest with both hands oh please sir please though the candlelight was dim he saw she was really frightened now my girl whats there to make a fuss about thats the way we say goodnight down where i live you ask my aunt she was already at the door wait a minute he pointed to the bolster lying on the carpet you take that thing with you and waken me half an hour before breakfast dont forget iii one morning when mrs blake was just about to put her bread in the oven nancy with a basket on her arm appeared at the kitchen door bidden to come in she did so rather hesitatingly i jist stopped for a minute miz blake im agoin up to the double s miss sapphys sent me to pick some laurel for her she spoke wanderingly and rather mournfully mrs blake noted is mother not feeling well she always likes to drive up the road and see the laurel herself yes mam maybe she dont feel right well youre jist puttin your bread in aint you there was no question in her voice but sorrowful comment the ovens not hot yet but it soon will be mrs blake lifted the stove lid to put in another stick nancy gasped and put out her hand beseechingly oh miz blake wait a minute please mam do i dont hardly know what to say but im afraid to go up the holler road this mornin afraid what of blacksnakes nom i aint afraid of no snakes mrs blake dropped the stick back into the woodbox the girl was afraid of something sure enough one could see it in her face and in the shivering irresolute way she stood there after covering her loaves with a white cloth mrs blake took her seat by the kitchen table now sit down nancy and tell me whats ailing you dont stand there cowerin but sit down and speak out yesm meekly it aint i minds goin up there its jist a nice walk only miss sapphy told me to go right before mr martin well whats that got to do with it she knowed he was goin ridin this mornin he had his leggins on she stopped and mrs blake waited in a moment nancy burst out oh miz blake hell shorely ride up there an overtake me in the woods she hid her face in her hands and began to cry you dont know how it is mam hes always apesterin me deed he is i has to do his room for him an hes always after me im shamed to tell you hell be shore to overtake me up in the woods i lost heart when i seen you was about to bake i thought maybe youd walk along up with me the baking can wait ill just check the damper and go along with you id like to see that laurel myself now you quit crying ill go upstairs and slip on another dress once in her own chamber mrs blake sat down to think her face was flushed and her eyes blazed with indignation she could not remember when mrs colbert had not driven daily up the hollow road to the double s while the laurel was in bloom of course she would take her usual drive up there tomorrow as she had done yesterday but today she was sending nancy why mrs colbert had turned on nancy that was well known now she had the worst rake in the country staying in her house and she was sending the girl up into the woods alone after giving him fair warning did her mother really want to ruin nancy could her spite go so far as that rachel blake closed her eyes and leaned her head and arms forward on her dresser top she had known her mother to show great kindness to her servants and sometimes cold cruelty but she had never known her to do anything quite so ugly as this if nancys tale were true but there was no time to puzzle it out now she must meet the present occasion she quickly changed her dress and came downstairs with a basket on her arm now step along nancy and brighten up well go flowerpicking to please ourselves it was still early morning a little too warm in the sun but wonderfully soft and pleasant in the shade the winding country road which climbed from the post office to timber ridge was then and for sixty years afterward the most beautiful stretch in the northwestern turnpike it was cut against gravelly hillsides bright with mica and thinly overgrown with spikes of pennyroyal patches of rue and small shrubs but on the left side of the road going west the hillsides fell abruptly down to a mountain stream flowing clear at the bottom of a winding ravine the country people called this the hollow or holler road on the far side of the creek the hills were shaded by forest trees tall and not too thickly set hickory and chestnut and white oak here and there hemlocks of great height the ground beneath them was covered with bright green moss and flat mats of wintergreen full of red berries out of the damp moss between the exposed tree roots where the shade was deep the maidenhair fern grew delicately the road followed the ravine climbing all the way until at the double s it swung out in four great loops round hills of solid rock rock which the destroying armament of modern roadbuilding has not yet succeeded in blasting away the four loops are now denuded and ugly but motorists however unwillingly must swing round them if they go on that road at all in the old times when nancy and mrs blake were alive and for sixty years afterward those nownaked hills were rich in verdure the winding ravine was deep and green the stream at the bottom flowed bright and soothingly vocal a tramp pedlar from town or a poor farmer coming down on foot from his stony acres to sell a coonskin stopped to rest here or walked lingeringly when the countrymen mentioned the place in speech if it were but to say id jist got as fur as the double ess their voices took on something slow and dreamy as if recalling the place itself the shade the unstained loveliness the pleasant feeling one had there mrs blake and nancy reached the curve of the first s and sat down on a log to rest looking across the creek at the forest trees which seemed even taller than they were rising one above another on the steep hillside there was no underbrush except such as was prized in kings gardens the laurel itself even in those days of slow and comfortless travel people came across the atlantic to see the kalmia in bloom the wayward wild laurel which in june covered the wooded slopes of our mountains with drifts of rose and peach and flesh colour and in winter when the tall trees above were grey and leafless the laurel thickets beneath them spread green and brilliant through the frosty woods well nancy said mrs blake after they had been sitting silent for a while we cant do better than this the creeks narrow here and we can easy get across on the stones they had not been long among the flowering bushes when mrs blake heard the sharp click of horseshoes on the higher loops of the double s she held up a warning finger the hoofbeats came closer and finally stopped presently there was a scraping sound of gravel and pebbles falling the rider had found a gully where he could tie his horse the laurelgatherers went on steadily about their work bending down high branches and letting them fly back again in a few moments young martin crossed the creek he must have seen two sunbonnets over there in the dark green bushes but he doubtless thought nancy had brought one of the coloured girls along with her mrs blake pushed back her bonnet and confronted him with that square brow so like the millers martin met the surprise admirably his face brightened he seemed delighted dropping his riding whip he snatched off his cap why cousin rachel have i caught you at last here ive been at the mill nearly two weeks and youve never once sent word youd like to see me is that the way to treat kinfolks she gave him her hand which he held longer than she liked you do come to the mill house dont you he asked yes i do but ive been occupied at this time of year im canning cherries youll let me come over and see you some night after supper i have messages for you i had to go to alexandria some time back she knew why and i went on to washington the house was in session and i met some of cousin michaels old friends they hadnt enough good to say of him really youd hear naught else of him said mrs blake dryly certainly not but a man may be a fine fellow and still not leave friends who will ask nothing better than to sit and talk about him six years after his death not many of us will leave friends wholl be missing us after six or seven years not many assented mrs blake and how did the gentlemen come to know you were related to mr blake by marriage i looked up his friends naturally you see they were all so glad to have any news of you and how you were doing they asked after you every time i saw them and sent you a great many messages thank you nancy and me have got our baskets full now and your horse is pawing on the rocks over there wed better be going cant i carry you home behind me you can ride without a pillion no thank you i partly came for the walk miss nancy maybe would like to get home before her flowers wilt he had the brass to make this suggestion as he stooped to pick up his riding whip no then let me carry the basket to aunt sapphy while the flowers are fresh nancy reluctantly handed him the basket mrs blake frowned wondering why she gave in to him thats a good girl martin smiled at her ran down the ravine and crossed the creek with the basket in his hand in a few moments they heard his horse trotting down the road during the homeward walk mrs blake said little but her face was flushed and grim you could put nothing past a colbert she told herself bitterly the effrontery of this scapegrace to go to washington and use michaels name to introduce himself been to alexandria lately of course he had and everyone knew why it was to get that blue tooth put in to replace the one the girls brothers had knocked out of his head on the blue ridge road a doctor in alexandria was known the country round for successful pivot work with this ignominious brand showing every time he opened his mouth mart colbert had gone to washington and nosed about the capitol until he found some of michaels friends and claimed kinship she had half a mind to tell nancy the whole story as a warning but the girl was already frightened and when she was distracted and fidgety she was likely to break things forget orders and exasperate her mistress as they parted at her gate mrs blake did say this much nancy girl if i was you i wouldnt go into the woods or any lonesome place while mr martin is here if you have to go off somewhere come by and ill go along if i happen to be away take mary and betty with you ill give them leave yes mam miz blake i wont thank you mam nancy drew her slender shoulders together as if she were cold some dark apprehension in her voice told more than she could say in words iv while he was dressing next morning martin wondered whether his ride had been spoiled by accident or by conspiracy had his cousin rachel whom he always found a bore gone into the woods on her own account or had the girl entreated her company well no matter he was a match for the two of them the only person he didnt want to offend was his aunt sapphy who had urged him to visit her and who seemed almost to be playing into his hand as he shaved his ruddy cheeks he forgot everything except that he wanted his ham and eggs mrs colbert was awaiting him in the diningroom now that martin was here she rose early in order to be dressed and coiffed before she joined him at breakfast after breakfast martin wheeled his aunt out on the porch to take the air excused himself and went upstairs to his room where he expected to find nancy making his bed but she was not there and the bed was still as he had left it nancy was playing truant that morning when she came up from the millers room she had caught up a basket and run away to the old cherry trees behind the smokehouse finding no ladder handy she went into the smokehouse to get pappy jeffs wooden chair jeff was there himself tending the fire in a big iron kettle set deep in the earth floor all day long through spring and summer the smoke from hickory chunks went up to cure and season the rows of hams and bacon hanging from the rafters of the roof pappy kin i have your cheer to climb up a cherry tree jeff rose from his squatting position sholy sholy honey i dont espect no compny but at that very moment sampsons tall figure darkened the doorway see now jeff chuckled i aint done said no compny an here come sampson run along chile him an mes got a little bizness to fix he dont need no cheer he kin squat on the flo like me sampson carried the chair out for her and planted it under a tree nancy scrambled nimbly up to the first big limb where she could sit comfortably could reach the cherries shining all about her and bend down the branches over her head the morning air was still so fresh that the sunlight on her bare feet and legs was grateful she was lighthearted this morning she loved to pick cherries and she loved being up in a tree someway no troubles followed a body up there nothing but the foolish dreamy nigger side of her nature climbed the tree with her she knew she had left half her work undone but here nobody would find her out to scold her the leaves over her head laughed softly in the wind maybe they knew she had run away she was in no hurry to pick the cherries she ate the ripest ones and dropped the hard ones into her basket presently she heard someone singing she sat very still and gently released the branch she was holding down he was coming from the stables she thought down by de canebrake close by de mill dar lived a yaller gal her name was nancy till should she scramble down likely as not he would go along the path through the garden and then he could not see her for the smokehouse he wouldnt come prowling around back here among the weeds but he did he came through the wet grass straight toward the cherry trees his straw hat in his hand singing that old darky song martin had gone to the kitchen to complain that nancy had not done his room and bluebell told him nancy was out picking cherries there never was a finer morning for picking cherries or anything else he was thinking as he went out to the kitchen garden and round the stables he didnt really intend to frighten the girl though he owed her one for the trick she played him yesterday good morning nancy he called up to her as he stood at the foot of the tree cherries are ripe eh do you know that song can you sing like bluebell no sir i cant sing i got no singin voice neither have i but i sing anyhow cant help it on a morning like this come now youre going to give me something nancy his tone was coaxing but careless she somehow didnt feel scared of him as he stood down there with his head thrown back his eyes were clear this morning and jolly he didnt look wicked maybe he only meant to tease her anyhow and she just didnt know how young men behaved over in the racing counties arent you going to give me something on such a pretty day lets be friends he held up his hand as if to help her down she didnt move but she laughed a soft darky laugh and dropped a bunch of cherries down to him i dont want cherries theyre sour and i want something sweet no mr martin the sour cherries is all gone these is blackhearts stop talking about cherries you look awful pretty sitting up there nancy giggled nervously martin was smiling all the time maybe he was just young and foolish like not bad whos your beau anyhow nancy till aint got none you goin to be a sour old maid i reckon i is now who in the world is that scarecrow comin on us nancy followed his eyes and looked back over her shoulder the instant her head was turned martin stepped lightly on the chair caught her bare ankles and drew her two legs about his cheeks like a frame nancy dropped her basket and almost fell out of the tree herself she caught at the branch above her and clung to it oh please get down mr martin do please somebodyll come along an youll git me into trouble martin laughed get you into trouble just this this is nothin but to cure toothache the girl had gone pale she was frightened now but she couldnt move couldnt pull herself up with him holding her so hard everything had changed in a flash he had changed and she couldnt collect her wits please mr martin please let me git down martin framed his face closer and shut his eyes pretty soon this is just nicesomething smells sweetlike may apples he seemed murmuring to himself not to her but all the time his face came closer her throat felt tight shut but she knew she must scream and she did pappy oh pappy come quick the moment she screamed martin stepped down from the chair old jeff came running round the end of the smokehouse up to the foot of the tree where nancy sat still holding on to the limb above her whassa matter chile whassa matter sampson followed more deliberately looking about himlooking at martin colbert which it was not his place to do nancy said she was took giddy like in the tree and was afraid she would faint and fall sampson got on the chair and lifted her down but before he did so he took it in that there were already wet boot tracks on the seat martin standing by remarked that if the girl had had any sense he would have helped her get out of the tree cose you would mr martin jeff jabbered young gals has dese sick spells come on em an den dey aint got no haid come along honey you kin walk pappyll hep you sampson picked up the chair and carried it back to the smokehouse martin strolled down the path muttering to himself god id rather it had been any other nigger on the place that millhand dont know where he belongs if ever he looks me in the face like that again ill break his head for him the niggers here dont know their place not one of em that afternoon martin went for a ride he was a trifle uncomfortable in mind he knew he had made a blunder he hadnt meant to do more than tease her but after he caught her and felt against his cheeks the shiver that went over her warm flesh he lost his head for an instant he knew she must be pursued carelessly and taken at the right moment off her guard he was vexed that he had let a pleasant contact an intoxicating fragrance run away with him never mind he would keep at a distance for a while as if he had forgotten the cherry tree riding home by the road from the post office he spied bluebell over yonder in the big vegetable garden immediately he dismounted and led his horse across the field toward her hello bluebell what are you up to ise apickin lettuce fo yo supper mr martin the slim black girl straightened up and stood with her bare feet wide apart between rows of lettuce you dont get outdoors much do you i always see you in the kitchen yes sir ise mosly heppin mammy this was spoken plaintively as if she had a hard life martin laughed he knew she was useless except as a companion to lizzie you find time to sing though aunt

rapidly and there was more energy in his step than common when little zach ran up to take his bridle he threw him the reins without a glance but he looked very angry and he was talking out loud to himself zach caught a few words by god if i thought that old sinner had been there before me the little nigger boy stared after the young man wondering what had put him out book vi sampson speaks to the master i though martins visit proved to be a long one his uncle saw very little of him he never asked the young man to come down to the mill indeed he put his nephew out of his mind as much as possible he realized that it meant a great deal to sapphira to have this foolish lively young fellow about the place certainly martin was very attentive to her chatted with her on the porch in the morning had tea with her in the afternoon played cribbage with her after supper one night when the miller was sitting at his readingtable he heard a knock at his door in answer to his come in sampson appeared yes sampson what is it the tall mulatto stood uneasily before him master henry id like to speak to you about something i got on my mind but i dont rightly know if its my place to speak out sampson mr henry im fraid mr martin worries nancy a right smart the miller looked up and frowned worries her what do you mean how worries her well sir you know how them young fellers is they likes to

nothin free nor unbecomin when she comes an goes nor have i shes a good girl and ill look after her thank you sir good night mr henry sampson withdrew but his face told that he was not reassured the miller closed his book and began to move slowly about the room in a flash he realized that from the first he had distrusted his nephew though he had never thought of him in connection with nancy to him nancy was scarcely more than a child it was his habit to refer to her in that way in reality of course she was a young woman his three daughters had married when they were younger than nancy was now wrath flamed up in him as he paced the floor against his nephew and the father who begot him against all his brothers and the colbert blood his own father he could hold in reverence he was an honest man and the woman who shared his laborious and thrifty life was a good woman but there must have been bad blood in the colberts back on the other side of the water and it had come to light in his three brothers and their sons he knew the family inheritance well enough he had his share of it but since his marriage he had never let it get the better of him he had kept his marriage vows as he would keep any other contract the miller got very little sleep that night when the first blush of the early summer dawn showed above the mountain he rose put on his long white cotton milling coat and went to bathe in the shallow pool that always lay under the big millwheel this was his custom after the hot close nights which often made sleep unrefreshing in summer the chill of the water and the rays of gold which soon touched the distant hills before the sun appeared restored his feeling of physical vigour he came back to his room leaving wet footprints on the floury floor behind him having dressed and shaved he put on his hat and walked down along the millrace toward the dam he did not know why but he felt strongly disinclined to see nancy this morning he did not wish to be there when she came to the mill it would not be the same as yesterday something disturbing had come between them since then for years ever since she was a child nancy had seemed to him more like an influence than a person she came in and out of the mill like a soft spring breeze a shy devoted creature who touched everything so lightly never before had anyone divined all his little whims and preferences and been eager to gratify them and it was for love from dutiful affection she had nothing to gain beyond the pleasure of seeing him pleased now that he must see her as a woman enticing to men he shrank from seeing her at all something was lost out of that sweet companionship for companionship it had been though it was but a smile and a glance a greeting in the fresh morning hours ii it was a little past midnight and sapphira had been asleep for an hour or more when she was rudely awakened nancy had burst in at her door and was calling out like someone startled yes miss sapphy here i is whassa matter mam nothing at all is the matter have you gone crazy nancy waking me up out of my sleep like this oh you called out missy you sholy did an i was havin bad dreams about you be more careful what you eat and dont come to me with your bad dreams you know if im once wakened its hard for me to get to sleep again im dreadful sorry missy i was sure i heard you callin an i feared you was taken bad maybe no mam i wont come in thoughtless agin maybe i better run down to mas cabin tonight if im agoin to be resless an disturb you you go right back to your own bed and control yourself properly i wont have such crazy behaviour yes mam nancy went out and closed the door softly behind her she sat down on her pallet and wrapped a quilt about her shoulders she did not lie down she would wait until it was time to roll up her bed and put it in the back closet her rushing in upon her mistress had been a ruse she had heard no call but she had heard somethinga cautious barefoot step on the wide stairway which led from the upper chambers down into the open hall where she lay on her pallet before the mistresss door the stair treads always creaked a little the dampness of the air kept the wood from drying thoroughly when the mistress sent her back to bed nancy told herself that if she heard that stealthy step again she would run down the hall and out the back door over to her mammys cabin she believed someone upstairs was listening as intently as she it was a horrible feeling if she had the start of him she knew she could outrun him but then there was the curved oak banister of the stairway smooth as glass anybody could slide down it without making a sound once he was in the hall she wouldnt have the start of him he would be there at last the first grey daylight came through the wide windows at the foot of the stairs it gave her a feeling of safety so sweet that she cuddled her head in her pillow and dozed a little for hours the object of her terror had been fast asleep in his upstairs chamber when he heard the sound of voices in his aunts room he had shrugged his shoulders and gone back to bed as the grey light grew stronger nancy rose very softly and dresseda simple process since in summer she went barefoot and slept in her sleeveless shimmy chemise she had only to tie her petticoat round her waist and slip her calico dress over her head she tiptoed down the long hall and ran out into the flower garden the sun was just coming up over the mountain fleecy pink clouds were scattered about the sky and the distant hills had turned gold a curling mist hung over the low meadows down by the mill dam the dew from the shrubbery was dripping in splashes upon the brick walks and on the boxwood hedges the silvery spiderwebs trembled with glistening waterdrops the tea roses and bleeding hearts hung heavy as if they would never rise again nobody was stirring in the negro cabins their overgrowth of trumpet vines and gourd vines was so wet that by running into them you could take a shower bath it made your skin pretty washing your face and arms in the dew oh this was a beautiful place nancy didnt believe there was a lovelier spot in the world than this right here she felt so joyful that her heart beat as hard as it did last night when she was scared she loved everybody in those vinecovered cabins everybody this morning she would be glad to see even fat lizzie and bluebell after all they were home folks and down yonder was the mill and the master so kind and so true that was in a song miss sapphy used to sing before she got sick and to nancy those words had always meant mister henry was it possible that she might have lost all this happiness last night the night just gone but it was still hers the home folks and the home place and the precious feeling of belonging here maybe that fright back there in the dark hall had been just a bad dream out here it didnt seem true lookathere the smoke was coming out of sampsons chimley aready he was up getting breakfast for his children and his wife who managed to be sick most of the time all the niggers knew that sampson not only got the breakfast in the small hours of the night he baked all the bread for his family what patience the man had and he never raised his low kind voice against anybody one morning soon after the above incident the miller found his wife sitting alone at breakfast and learned that his nephew had ridden off to winchester for the day i hope he wont use my horse too hard he remarked when is he coming back tomorrow i think the miller was silent for a moment then said with a shade of impatience how long is mart going to hang around here anyway we cant very well ask our kin how long they intend to stay with us can we maybe not but hes been here about six weeks and thats a long visit sapphira smiled i remember my father used to tell how benjamin franklin said hospitality like fish stinks after three days that may be true in the north but we dont feel that way in virginia i hope sapphira ive had about enough of martins company i never liked his fathers ways and i dont like his what does he want here anyway maybe the boy wants a refugefrom creditors or from the men of families where hes brought disgrace her husband muttered she shook her finger at him now dont be too hard on him henry your brothers were all like that you know and martin has a gentlemanly side which they had not i am certainly not very lively company for a young blade to spend his evenings with but if he is dull here he never shows it certainly i shall miss him when he is gone well if you take pleasure in his company i shant say anything but he will demoralize the servants his way with the young darkies is too free he goes into the woods across the creek to hunt mushrooms with that trifling bluebell if the servants go wrong from any visitor in the house its their own fault i think they know their place better bluebell is a lazy lying nigger as ever was but ive found her smart enough to look out for herself i doubt whether martin would so demean himself but its no affair of mine sapphira laughed softly it was almost as good as a play she was thinking the way whenever she and her husband were thinking of nancy they invariably talked about bluebell iii haying time was coming on and now the miller turned farmer he left the mill to sampson and spent the mornings about the barns and stables looking after the condition of the horses mending the racks seeing that taylor cleared the haylofts of old straw and aired them for the new crop every year in haying time and harvest he gave his millwheels a rest he believed the work in the open air was good for his health as he left the barn one morning and was going through the negro quarters he passed by the laundry cabin where nancy did fine laundering for the mistress hearing voices within the girls voice and his nephews he stopped short by the rainbarrel and listened martin was speaking in a drawling bantering way how about my fine shirts you were going to wash and iron for me miss nancy till yes sir the mistress told me to if youll please put em out in the hall for me ill do em up today now lookahere my girl you just hunt in the press and find them for yourself i dont keep account of my shirts if you take care of my room you look out for my washing i aint my own chambermaid the miller stepped forward and glanced in at the open door nancy was at the ironingboard her eyes fixed on her work martin in his riding breeches was lounging on an old broken chair his back against the wall and his legs stretched out in front of him his face was turned away but his lordly lazy attitude and the rough familiarity of his voice were not lost upon his uncle colbert set his teeth and hurried through the yard down to the mill sampson he called this fine weather wont last much longer maybe i told taylor we would begin on the long meadow tomorrow and you and me will go out with the men itll likely be a hot day and we must get to work early before the grass is dry the women can turn it afterward youll have to go and hunt up the scythes its taylors business but he hasnt done it i could only find six and therell be eight of us in the field sampson smiled reassuringly i specs i can find em sir the boys sneaks em away fur one thing an another but ill find em early the next morning mrs blakes little girls were awakened by the ringing sound of whetstones on scythe blades the long meadow between their house and the mill was always the first field to be cut the mowers had assembled down by the rail fence where the sassafras bushes screened the field from back creek the miller went round the group and felt the edge of every blade now boys i reckon were ready to begin look out and keep the line straight the darkies scattered to their places spat into their palms and gripped the handholds colbert and sampson were in the centre and after the master had cut the first swath the men threw themselves into the easy position of practised mowers and the long grass began to fall they advanced from east to west steadily like a good team at the plough colbert allowed only the seasoned mowers to work with him the young fellows he hired out in haytime to learn under his neighbours as the darkies swung their scythes they made a deep sound from the chest the huhhuh they made when they chopped wood but they never paused except to spit into their hands the sun had been up several hours when the line of mowers got as far as the little iron spring which seeped up in the meadow with a patch of tiger lilies growing round it here the master beckoned the hands to come and take a drink the water was cold and strongly flavoured with iron the darkies passed the gourd around more than once and stood easy straightening their backs and wiping their sweaty faces on shirtsleeves already wringing wet every man of them kept an old hat of some sort on his head after they had rested a few minutes they pulled up their breeches at the waist and went back to their places when the line moved on the blackspotted orange lilies stood straight and tall above the fallen grass by and by the men began to look up anxiously at the sun only a little spell now they kept in line but they certainly advanced more slowly a cheering halloo rang out across the field the men stopped and straightened up with a grateful sigh looking toward the mill house stile yonder came young martin carrying in each hand a gallon jug and behind him came nancy and bluebell and nelly and trudy and little zach all with baskets it was the custom for the mowers to have their dinner in the field the scythes were left beside the swath last cut and the hands gathered in the shade under a widespreading maple tree in every hayfield one big tree was left for that purpose it was always called the mowers tree after they had spread a red tablecloth on the grass and laid out the provisions the women went away the jugs martin had brought were full of cold tea the master poured himself a full gourd but the men drank from the jugit went round from mouth to mouth as they fell to their dinner a pitiful figure of a negro came toward the group not approaching directly but circling to right and left and looking down in the grass as if he were hunting for some lost object the darkies grinned and nudged one another dars tansy dave bout time he was drappin long the master spoke to sampson call him up poor fellow in a voice that was quiet and yet carried far the yellow man called master says hurry up dave or there wont be nothin left the scarecrow man barelegged his pants torn away to the knee his shirt a dirty rag approached slowly his head hanging down he muttered something about been havin a sorta spell lately an didnt know as he oughta eat nothin the master spoke up this is a good dinner dave set down an eat all you want weve got plenty daves mournful face brightened as he looked hungrily at what was spread on the red cloth he took the chunks of corn bread and fried middling meat sampson handed him and drew apart from the others just on the edge of the shade line he sat down and ate his food after dinner the hands lay under the tree and slept for an hour lay on their backs with their old hats over their faces the miller sat leaning against the trunk and watched the ragged visitor steal across the mown field and hide himself in the sassafras bushes along the rail fence he was thinking it was a dreary business to be responsible for other folks lives time was when poor dave that halfwitted ghost of a man was one of the happiest boys on the place he and tap were the ringleaders in all the farm festivals dave was very clever with his mouthorgan and he used to play for the darkies to dance on the hardpacked earth in the back yard it was six years now since he began to go to pieces six years ago a lady from baltimore mrs morrison had come to board with a relative three miles down the creek she brought with her her coloured maid susanna who used to come over to dance with the colbert darkies she was a taking wench with big soft eyes and an irresistible gigglelight on her feet and a pretty dancer colbert and sapphira sometimes went out to watch her dance while dave played his mouthorgan and the other darkies patted with their hands dave always escorted her home lizzie told the mistress that every night after supper dave changed his shirt and went down the creek to court susanna and before he started he rolled over and over in the tansy bed to make hisself smell sweet the nickname tansy dave had stuck to him long after he ceased to go acourting and after he no longer tried to make hisself smell sweet when mrs morrison was packing to go back to the city dave came to sapphira and begged her to buy susanna so that he could marry her they were promised he said and susanna wanted to stay at first his mistress laughed at him but he cried like a little boy threw himself on the floor and declared he would run away and foller her if she was took off on the cars mrs colbert was melted by the boys desperation she told him to get up and behave himself and she would think it over she did think it over and talked about it to henry that night both agreed it would be foolish to buy another girl when they had too many already but early next morning sapphira wakened her husband to tell him she had decided to buy susanna if the woman would take a reasonable price for her the girl was a good seamstress and she could do all the fine sewing about the house sapphira ordered the carriage and drove away soon after breakfast the miller doubted her success but he said nothing susannas mistress had once come to the baptist church and he did not like her arrogant manner or the look of her she had a small hard face white as flour when sapphira returned she sent down to the mill for her husband she was greatly put out the woman had told her at once that she thoroughly disapproved of slaveowning when her late husbands shipping interests took him from bath maine to baltimore she had found it necessary to purchase two negroes for house service in baltimore there was no other way to get good servants she would not sell susanna at any price the girl was trained for work in a town house and after she got back to baltimore she would never think of this crazy nigger again susanna and her mistress left the neighbourhood and dave ran away as he had threatened he walked to winchester and got on the cars when he reached harpers ferry and was told he must wait there for the big train that went on to washington he lost heart after a few days he came wandering home but he was never the same boy again he went from bad to worse spent days often weeks in the mountains wherever there was a still and moonshine whisky nowadays he lived in the mountains the summer through in the fall he came down to the mill to borrow sampsons gun and go hunting dave could perfectly imitate the call of the wild turkey and he brought those wary birds home for the table the mistress was very fond of them colbert often wondered at sapphiras forbearance with dave when he traded his clothes for whisky and slunk home without a shirt to his back she would make him go wash himself in the creek burn his rags and put on a whole pair of pants and a new hickory shirt soon he would disappear again and not come back till winter taylor was pretty sure to find him in the barn some morning after the first hard freeze buried deep in the hay sapphira saw that he was clothed and fed through the winter even lizzie had pity on him but she would not let him come into the kitchen to eat with the other hands she filled a little bucket with victuals and handed it out to him the men finished cutting the long meadow before sundown that night the miller excused himself early from the supper table admitting that he was tired he would limber up in a few days he told his wife but tonight his arms and back ached from unaccustomed exercise once in his room at the mill he threw himself upon his bed and lay still watching the lingering twilight die he looked forward to the next two weeks which would take the soreness out of his back and mind it was good for him to be out in the fields to feel his strength drunk up by the earth and sun and to set the pace for younger men at cutting grass and wheat this was a troubled time for henry colbert when he was alone with his thoughts he was too often preoccupied with what sampson had told him now and then the actual realization of martins designs would flash into his mind the poison in the young scamps blood seemed to stir something in his own the colbert in him threatened to raise its head after long hibernation not that he was afraid of himself for nothing on earth even by a glance would he trouble that sweet confidence and affection which had been a comfort to him for so long but it was not now the comforting thing it had been now he tried to avoid nancy her light step on the old axdressed boards of the mill floor her morning smile did not bring the lift of spirit they used to bring he told himself that in trying to keep a close watch on martin he had begun to see through martins eyes sometimes in his sleep that preoccupation with martin the sense of almost being martin came over him like a black spell how was he to get rid of the fellow in those days and in that country a man could not put his nephew out of the house unless he had flagrantly outraged hospitality the miller had thought seriously of trying to buy martin off that seemed the likeliest possibility though the approach would be awkward offering a near kinsman money to clear out of the neighbourhood nevertheless he had gone to winchester the week before the hay was ripe and had drawn from the bank a larger sum of money than he customarily kept on hand it was now locked in his secretary drawer he liked to feel that it was there ready before he undressed for the night colbert took from the shelf a book he often read john bunyans holy wara copy printed in glasgow in 1763 he opened the book at a passage relating to the state of the town of mansoul after diabolus had entered her gates and taken up his rule there also things began to grow scarce in mansoul now the things that her soul lusted after were departing from her upon all her pleasant things there was a blast and a burning instead of a beauty wrinkles now and some shews of the shadow of death were upon the inhabitants of mansoul and now o how glad would mansoul have been to enjoyed quietness and satisfaction of mind though joined with the meanest condition in the world next he turned to the pages describing the state of mansoul after she had been retaken and reclaimed by prince emmanuel the son of god when the town of mansoul had thus far rid themselves of their enemies and of the troublers of their peace a strict commandment was given out that yet my lord willbewill should search for and do his best to apprehend what diabolonians were yet alive in mansoul he also apprehended carnalsense and put him in hold but how it came about i cannot tell but he brake prison and made his escape yea and the bold villain will not yet quit the town but lurks in the diabolonian dens at days and haunts like a ghost honest mens houses at nights in this book he found consolation an honest man who had suffered much was speaking to him of things about which he could not unbosom himself to anyone book vii nancys flight i the wheat harvest was nearly over nancy and her companions had been carrying dinner to the mowers in the big wheat field on the other side of back creek on her way home nancy slipped from the company and ran through mrs blakes yard to her kitchen door mary and betty had finished washing the dishes and their mother was preparing to roast coffee beans in the oven after one look at nancys face she told the children they could go down the road and watch grandfather cutting his wheat when they were gone she turned to the yellow girl whats the matter now child has that scamp been pestering you again set down and tell me nancy dropped into a chair oh im most drove outa my mind i caint bear it no longer deed i caint i gets no rest night nor day im goin to throw myself into the millpawnd i am she bowed her head on her arms and broke into sobs hush hush dont talk so nancy its wicked stop your crying and tell me about it she stood over the girl stroking her quivering shoulders until the sobs grew more throaty and as it were dried up nancy lifted her face miz blake yous the only one i got to talk to hes just after me night an day till i wisht id never been bawn i guess a good many of us wish that sometimes but we come right again and bear our lot have you said anything to my father how could i miz blake id die a shame to speak it before that good ole man i got

any night if i happens to fall asleep i got nobody to call to i caint do nothin here nancy sprang from her chair and stood with her hands pressed against her forehead and her blueblack hair i tell you id druther drown myself before he got at me than after only i want somebody asll speak up for me to the master an tell him i didnt do it from wickedness please mam tell him how i was drove to it when she spoke of the master she began to cry again and could not go on presently mrs blake said quietly but resolutely im agoing to get you away from all this nancy mind you no more talk about the mill dam youre young and have life before you ive seen how things were going and ive been figuring on how to get you away from the mill youve not been real happy over there for a good while back nom not since she turned on me nancy spoke absently as if talking to herself it aint nothing she does to me i don know what it is but she never looks at me no more shes jist turned on me mrs blake took her by the shoulders as if to rouse her now you must listen to me nancy would you be brave enough to go away from here to a better place where youd be safe i cant run mart colbert out of the neighbourhood but i think i can get you away would you go id go anywheres to git away from him id sooner go down to georgia an pick cotton deed i would it wont come to that nancy just you hold out a little longer and ill get you out of these troubles have you said anything to till nancy looked up at her with wondering startled eyes to maw how could i mam mrs blake turned away and began to put slow wood in her stove to get on with her roasting here come my girls up the road you better let them go along home with you maybe mothers missed you but if theyre with you nothing will be said after nancy and the children were gone mrs blake sat down to watch over the pans of browning coffee she understood why nancy did not go to till for advice and protection till had been a dodderidge before ever she was nancys mother in tills mind her first duty was to her mistress ever since mrs colbert had become an invalid tills position in the house was allimportant and position was dear to her long ago matchem had taught her to value her place and that became her rule of life anything that made trouble between her and the mistress would wreck the order of the household nancy had come into the world by accident the other relation that with the dodderidges till regarded as one of the fixed conditions you were born into beginning with jezebel her kin had lived under the roof and protection of that family for four generations it was their natural place in the world yes mrs blake knew why till shut her eyes to what was going on over at the mill house and she realized once more that she herself was by nature incapable of understanding her mother ever since she could remember she had seen her mother show shades of kindness and cruelty which seemed to her purely whimsical at this moment mrs blake could not for the life of her say whether mrs colbert had invited this scapegrace to her house with the deliberate purpose of bringing harm to nancy or whether she had asked him merely for the sake of his company and was now ready to tolerate anything that might amuse him and thus prolong his stay this was quite possible since mrs colbert though often generous was entirely selfcentred and thought of other people only in their relation to herself she was born that way and had been brought up that way yet one must admit inconsistencies there was her singular indulgence with tansy dave her real affection for till and old jezebel her patience with sampsons lazy wife even now from her chair she took some part in all the celebrations that darkies love she liked to see them happy on christmas morning she sat in the long hall and had all the men on the place come in to get their presents and their christmas drink she served each man a strong toddy in one of the big glass tumblers that had been her fathers when tap the mill boy smacked his lips and said miss sapphy if my mammys titty had atasted like that i never would agot weaned she laughed as if she had never heard the old joke before when the darkies were sick she doctored them sent linen for the new babies and had them brought for her to see as soon as the mother was up and about recalling these things and trying to be fair to her mother mrs blake suddenly rose from her chair and said aloud no it aint put on she believes in it and they believe in it but it aint right ii by the next mornings stage mrs bywaters sent an important letter to david fairhead asking him to come out to back creek as soon as possible he rode up to her gate next evening on his old grey horse that night mrs blake and mr whitford the carpenter met at the post office to confer with him when they were seated in the postmistresss private parlour where they would not be disturbed mrs blake revealed her bold purpose mrs bywaters sat by to encourage her to the two women the plan seemed a desperate undertaking no negro slave had ever run away from back creek or from hayfield or round hill or even from winchester but mr fairhead was reassuring he told them the underground railroad was now busier than ever before the severe fugitive slave law passed six years ago had by no means prevented slaves from running away its very injustice had created new sympathizers for fugitives and opened new avenues of escape from as far away as louisiana negroes were now reaching canada the railroads and the lake steamboats helped them if a negro once got into pennsylvania or ohio he seldom failed to go through fairhead explained to mrs blake how simple it would be to get nancy from winchester to martinsburg and from there into pennsylvania while she sat by he wrote a letter to his cousin in martinsburg who would be very glad to assist her this letter would go off by the stage tomorrow morning mr whitford said he could manage for mrs blake as far as winchester he had a light canvascovered springwagon in which he carried coffins to distant buryinggrounds chairs for two women could be put inside under the canvas and they could make the drive to town unseen by anyone travelling late at night they would reach winchester in good time to take the morning stage for martinsburg mrs blake went home greatly reassured but the hardest thing to arrange the interview she most dreaded was still before her the following night she set out for the mill by the creek road where she would scarcely be likely to meet any of the house servants once at the mill she went to the north window of her fathers room he was within sitting at his table not reading but gazing moodily at the floor can i come in father she asked quietly is that you rachel wait a minute he came out to the platform where the wagons were unloaded took her hand and led her through the dark passage to his room when he closed the door he shot the bolt mrs blake sat down and drew a long breath well father ive come over to have a talk with you i blame myself i didnt come before this i reckon you know what its about she looked to him for recognition but he sat frowning at the floor it tried her that he gave her no encouragement when he certainly must know what was on her mind she was tired and the road round by the creek had seemed long father she broke out indignantly are you going to stand by and see a good girl brought to ruin without lifting a finger the miller crossed the room and shut down the open window his face had flushed red and so had mrs blakes she went on with some heat you surely know that rake mart colbert is after nancy day and night hell have her in the end shes a good girl but the colbert men never let anything get away hell catch her somewhere and force her her father clenched his two powerful fists no he wont its only by the mercy of god i havent strangled the life out of him before now then why dont you do something to save her he made no reply his daughter sat watching him in astonishment his darkly flushed face his clenched hands gave her no clue to what was going on in his mind struggle of some sort certainly she had always known him quick to act had never seen him like this before i may be overstepping my duty she said at last but i couldnt sit with my hands folded and see whats going on here shes come to me for help and i couldnt hold back im agoing to get nancy away from here and on the road to freedom he looked up now and met her eyes with a flash in his own if only it were possible rachel well it is possible mr fairheads offered to help me it aint so hard as it seems to us out here slaves are running away in plenty now hes got quaker friends that will get the girl into pennsylvania about five miles out of martinsburg theres a ferry will take me and nancy across the potomac when we get across a conveyance will meet us and carry her on from house to house in a day and a night i can get her into safe hands and then whats to become of her the quakers will get her somehow over into new york state an put her on the cars theres a railroad runs right up through vermont into canada outa reach of slavecatchers he says the railroad men are glad to help its agoing on all the time now they hide runaway slaves in the baggage cars an take em clear through to montreal montreal now what would a young girl like her do in a big strange city an they talk nothing but french up there ive heard you must be gone crazy rachel there shed come to harm for certain a pretty girl like her shed be enticed into one of them houses like as not the miller wiped his forehead with his big handkerchief the closed room was getting very hot father i can tell you theres many folks in big cities that are a sight kinder than some folks on this farm you know mother bears a hard hand on nancy and has for a good while back how the girls stood it i dont know god forgive me but it looks to me like shed brought that scamp here apurpose an shes tried right along to throw the girl in his way she knows nancy lays unprotected out in the open hall every night where he can sneak down to her hes tried it moren once an the pore thing had to run in to old washington in the wine closet an he let her have his cot another time the miller sprang to his feet knocking over the chair behind him hush rachel not another word you and me cant talk about such things it aint right what do you come telling this to me for if youve fixed it up with mr fairhead and whitford i cant be a party to make away with your mothers property i come to you because we need money a hundred dollars to get her safe through into canada an i aint got it if i had id turn to nobody henry colbert walked slowly about the room his eyes downcast he was ashamed to show such irresolution before his daughter she would think he grudged the money maybe the money was there in his secretary it made her plan possible made it almost an accomplished fact a loss that could never be made up to him he had been humouring himself with the hope that once martin was out of the way things might be as they used to be but every word his daughter said made him know nancy could never be the same again could never be happy here he must face it rachel he said presently in his natural voice nothing must pass between you and me on this matter neither words nor aught else tomorrow night i will go to bed early and i will leave my coat hanging on a chair by the open window here he raised the north window and propped it up on its stick now i will walk home with you no father thank you we might meet somebody id sooner we werent seen together tonight the following night mrs blake came again to the mill by the creek road her fathers room was dark but the window was open she put in her hand took out the coat that hung on the chairback and felt through the pockets from the inside pocket she took a flat package of banknotes the miller in his bed heard her come and go he lay still and prayed earnestly for his daughter and for nancy not a sparrow falleth to the ground without thy knowledge he would never again hear that light footstep outside his door she would go up out of egypt to a better land maybe she would be like the morning star this child the last star of night she was to go out from the dark lethargy of the caredfor and irresponsible to make her own way in this world where nobody is altogether free and the best that can happen to you is to walk your own way and be responsible to god only sapphiras darkies were better cared for better fed and better clothed than the poor whites in the mountains yet what ragged shaghaired squirrelshooting mountain man would change places with sampson his trusted head miller iii mr whitford was to be at mrs blakes house at one oclock in the morning starting at that hour he would be unlikely to meet travellers on the road and he would get into winchester well before daylight he and his passengers were to have an early breakfast with the old quaker who was a friend of the miller and of mr fairhead from the quakers house they would take the stage for martinsburg if mrs blake chanced to meet an acquaintance on the street or in the stage it was quite natural that she should be going to martinsburg on a visit attended by her mothers maid nancy was to come over to mrs blakes about midnight when all was still at the mill house she got up from her pallet dressed in the dark and slipped out of the back door carrying her shoes and stockings in one hand and in the other an old pillowcase stuffed with her spare clothes and her few belongings when she got to the stile she sat down behind it and put on her shoes it was the dark of the moon and anyone crossing the meadow could not easily be recognized but if she met anyone the fact that she was wearing her winter shawl and a hat would arouse curiosity to travel as mrs blakes ladys maid she must be dressed for town her hat was an old black turban of mrs colberts till had put a red feather on it when nancy accompanied her mistress to winchester at easter mrs blake was sitting on her doorstep waiting and her house was dark she drew a sigh of relief when she saw a figure come out of the meadow and cross the road she met nancy at the gate took her into the parlour pulled down the blinds and lighted a candle now nancy heres my old carpet sack im going to give it to you for your own and you can pack away in it whatever youve got in your bundle there from now on we must look spruce like we was going visiting im glad youve got a feather in your hat its real becoming to you and it was a good hat in the first place when mother got it i see youve brought along one of the old reticules that will be handy to carry the letters ive written out for you to show to the quaker folks and maybe to the railroad men telling how youre a deserving girl and i stand behind you but when i give you your money in martinsburg you must put it in your stockings never let it off your body oh miz blake the reticule aint mine miss sapphy give it to me yisterday with three pairs aher good silk stockings for me to darn i did mean to darn em today but some way i jist couldnt git down to it i been kinda flighty in the haid like ill mend em as soon as i git there an send em back by stage or somehow nancy was nervously packing the carpetbag as she spoke mrs blake glanced up and then stepped quickly into the kitchen to get command of herself she thought how vague even to her was this there that nancy spoke ofthere was canada wasnt it mrs blake herself had never been farther north than baltimore she had always thought of boston as very very far north and montreal was away away longer off than boston and nancy spoke of sending things back by stage for a moment she felt her courage sink when she returned to the parlour she set about straightening the tidies on the chairs speaking over her shoulder in a matterof fact tone you better leave your darning right here ill mend em up neatly and send em over things often get lost on the stage listen theres mr whitford for sure hes stopped his horses at our gate ill get my things on a few minutes later mrs blake walked out of her door in her sunday best even to black gloves and nancy walked behind her carrying the carpet sack mr whitford helped them into the back of his wagon and then untied his horses very soon the team splashed through back creek mrs blake had a moment of apprehension and glanced at nancy but the girl seemed worn out and dulled by the days excitement her head drooped forward on her knees as if she were dozing it was not until they were passing the old elliot place and a jolt over a limestone ledge threw her chair to one side that she wakened up the houses along the road were all dark the first lighted windows were in the disreputable tavern near hoag creek a place where bad men got together moonshiners and sheepstealers and fistfighters who wore brass knuckles in a fight drank bad whisky and threw dice and told dirty stories about decent folk until daybreak the sound of horses hoofs on the road at this late hour brought the revellers reeling and shouting out into the road hold on stranger give us a ride up the gap who be ye issa damned govment officer pull him in an fill him up fellers hes after moonshiners an well show him some well give him a whole bellyfula moonshine bill hooker who had only one eye and bragged he had never cut his hair caught the horses by the bits but they kicked at him and he fell in the road drag him out whitford called and go back where you came from im whitford of back creek and im carrying a coffin home the rowdies let out a spiritless yell or two and stumbled back toward the tavern hope you wasnt scared mrs blake said whitford its funny those fellows dont blink an eye at murder but they dont like to interfere with a corpse iv in martinsburg mr taverner mr fairheads cousin met the stage and took mrs blake and her companion to his house where his wife made them very comfortable after dark he drove the two women out to the ferry in his buggy he had warned the ferryman that he would be sending two friends across tonight so the ferryman asked no questions he said good evening mam to mrs blake and held out his hand to help her into the boat nancy followed she had never been in a boat before never seen any stream wider than back creek the potomac ran strong here leaped over ledges and boulders with a roaring sound like a waterfall it was cold out on the river and the churned water threw up a light spray nancys winter shawl was not heavy enough to keep out the chill mrs blake could feel her shivering as they sat on the narrow seat the boat swayed and swung on its wire however carefully the ferryman used his oars to right it once mrs blake thought they certainly had broken loose when they reached shallow water the ferryman tied up his boat and helped the two women to climb up the rocks to level ground he called hello but there was no answer we got a little cabin here where passengers waits their folks is sometimes late comin you better come in an set down on the bench till your folks come dont be skeered of nothin ill be around mr taverner told me one of the passengers was to go back ill be right around where you kin call me mrs blake and nancy sat huddled together in the damp little hut which smelled of tobacco smoke and rotting wood a cricket was chirping sharply inside and outside was the perpetual agitating rush of the rivera beautiful sound when you are not frightened but nancy was and mrs blake was disappointed so far the journey had been swift and pleasant but this halt was a little disturbing she could feel the courage oozing out of the girl beside her it might be best to say something something practical to divert nancys thoughts she asked her to feel whether her garters were tied tight and her money safe in her stockings in a flash she knew she had said the wrong thing the girl wilted altogether oh miz blake please mam take me home i cant go off amongst strangers its too hard let me go back an try to do better i dont mind miss sapphy scoldin why she brought me up an now shes sick an sufferin look at her pore feet i oughta borne it better miz blake please mam i want to go home to the mill an my own folks now dont talk foolish what about martin i kin keep outa his way miz blake he wont be there always i cant bear it to belong nowheres youve been a brave girl right along an you mustnt fail me now i took a big risk to get you this far if we went back mother would never forgive younor me it would be worse than before these quaker folks will be kind to you an youll be bright an happy like you used to be if you aint happy when you get to your journeys end ill fetch you back somehow dont give way after all mr fairhead and mr whitford have done for you remember you were ready to throw yourself in the mill dam yesm the girl breathed but mrs blake didnt believe she had heard her at all she couldnt take anything in her mind was frozen with homesickness and dread after that they sat in silence the nerveracking suspense did not go on much longer through the rushing of the river mrs blake thought she heard the rattle of wheels and hoofs over a stony road listen i believe theyre coming now listen she hurried out of the cabin dragging nancy after her an old chaise emerged from the dark wood and the driver got out he was a coloured man she knew at once from his voice a negro preacher as it proved and a freed man in greeting mrs blake he took off an old beaver hat which he wore as the sign of his calling is this miz blake im fraid i kep you waitin mam i had some trouble on de way de road from williamsport on is very bad an theys been heavy rains de folks sent me along to drive cause reverend fairhead wrote how de gal was young an easy skeered i am a minister of de gospel well known hereabouts an dey figgered she wouldnt feel so strange wid me im glad you came uncle the girls lost heart a little shes never been away from home before an shes afraid with strangers the tall black man turned to nancy and put a hand on her shoulder dey aint strangers where youre goin honey dey calls theyselves friends an dey is friends to all gods people youll be treated like dey had raised you up from a chile an youll be passed along on yo way from one kind fambly to de next dey got a letter all bout you from de reverend fairhead an dey all feels quainted we must be goin now chile we want to git over the line into pennsylvany as early tomorrer as we kin there was something solemn yet comforting in his voice like the voice of prophecy when he gave nancy his hand she climbed into the chaise he put her bag in after her then turned to mrs blake still holding his hat over his chest an you lady the lawd will sholy bless you fo he said hisself blessed is the merciful he untied his team and waited a moment but nancy never said a word not to him not to mrs blake she had stood dumb all the while the old man spoke to her as if she were drugged indeed she was by the bitterest of all drugs the preacher clucked to his horses seeing that the girl had no word of farewell to say but as they started off mrs blake called out to her goodbye nancy we shall meet again book viii the dark autumn i mrs bywaterss youngest son walked into mrs blakes yard one morning with a letter she was sitting in her parlour by an open window sewing he took off his cap and went to speak to her through the window good day mrs blake i brought a letter for you mother said it must have been slipped into the letterbox late last night for she didnt find it till she was stamping the mail for the stage this morning she thought it might be important so she sent me down with it thank you jonathan that was real thoughtful of your mother after jonathan went away mrs blake sat contemplating the envelope he had brought it was addressed in her mothers neat handwriting she had heard nothing from the mill farm since her return from winchester by stage three days agoexcept from bluebell that spineless darky girl doubtless sent by lizzie had come across the meadow after dark and guilelessly asked mrs blake if she had seen nothin of nancy lately nobody at home had seen her an they was agittin right worried taylor he thought they ought to drag the mill dam but trudy said maybe she was astayin over to miz blakes or was someers miz blake knowed about no mrs blake knew nothing of nancys whereabouts and bluebell had better run along home as mrs blake was going to a prayer meeting at the church yesm is agoin we caint find out nothin at home cause miss sapphy aint once spoke nancys name since we foun her bed empty one mawnin an till aint spoke her name nuther when maw axed her where was nancy she jist tole her to mind her business but we speck till had some talk wid de missus cause right from the fust day tills been doin masters room an mr martins seem like till dont miss her gal much las night when taylor axed her mus he drag de mill dam she tole him he could do what he pleased an not to come pesterin her mrs blake resolutely put on her bonnet and pointed to the kitchen door when bluebell went out she shut it behind her and drew the bolt this was the only word she had had from the mill people the letter jonathan had brought was doubtless something final since it bore a stamp and came through the post office people on back creek did not send letters to their neighbours through the post a note to be sent up or down the road was not even put into an envelope it was folded turned down at one corner and carried to the addressee by one of the boys or girls about the place government stamps were considered an extravagance at last mrs blake opened the letter and read mistress blake is kindly requested to make no further visits at the mill house sapphira dodderidge colbert well that was best mrs blake agreed as she folded up the paper her mother would meet this situation with dignity as she had met other misfortunes she would not set the slavecatchers on to track nancy she would not question anyone she knew of course that the girl could never have got away without help and this letter told that she understood who had contrived her escape the colbert darkies must know that mrs blakes house had been closed for two days and that mary and betty stayed with mrs bywaters while their mother was away she was sorriest for the hurt this would be to her mothers pride nancys disappearance would be the talk of the neighbourhood every time mrs colbert drove out she would meet inquiring faces the whisperings and surmises among her own servants would be a trial to her mrs blake knew how her mother hated to be overreached or outwitted and she was sorry to have brought another humiliation to one who had already lost so much her activity on horse and foot her fine figure and rosy complexion the property loss mrs colbert would bear lightly tansy dave was certainly a property loss and she had never complained or tried to punish him but if he had actually run away and stayed in baltimore his mistress would likely enough have had him seized and brought back a girl like nancy refined and very pretty skilful with her needle and in chamber work would easily fetch a thousand dollars maybe more but mrs blake did her mother the justice to believe that this money out was not the thing that cut to the quick she unfolded the letter again and as she looked at it tears rose slowly to her eyes its hard for a body to know what to do sometimes she murmured to herself i hate to mortify her maybe i ought to athought about how much she suffers and her poor feet like nancy said to me that night in the dark cabin by that roaring river maybe i ought to have thought and waited all through the month of august mrs blake was busy sewing for her girls to get them ready for school she saw no one from the mill house except her father who walked home with her from church every sunday nancys name was never mentioned between them one sunday morning fat lizzie caught mrs blake outside the church door and came at her howdy miz blake now maybe you knows when nancy is comin home i axed miss sapphy only yisteday an she says to me she sposed nancyd come back from chesnut hill when she was sent fur now tap come up wid a nigger from chesnut hill in winchester an he tells tap dey aint never seen sight a nancy down dar it begins to look like taylors right an she drownded hersef in de dam he says dats all a pack a lies bout dem risin to de top in fo days she might easy aketched on a big root an be down dar still by this time a dozen eager listeners had gathered round and mrs blake gave lizzie a dark look here comes your master you had better ask him lizzie turned and saw the miller coming up the path with a god amighty she hurried into the church and up the narrow stairs to the gallery as fast as a woman of her figure could go after the first october frosts when everyone went into the woods to gather chestnuts and hickory nuts mrs blake and her two little girls happened to come upon a nutting party from the mill house till was among them she met mrs blake with such warmth as she seldom betrayed and called her by her given name its surely nice to lay eyes on you agin miss rachel it does me good to see you lookin fine and hearty mrs blake asked after her mothers health im right worried about her miss rachel doctor clavenger comes out from winchester every week to see her sometimes he draws the water off an then shes easier she dont git up for breakfast no more she stays in bed all day till i dresses her an takes her into the parlour for tea their talk was suddenly interrupted by shouts and scrambling tap the nimblest of the mill boys had climbed a tall chestnut tree and was thrashing the branches with a pole the little darkies shouted as the nuts showered down and all the women fell on their knees and began scratching among the dried leaves and stuffing the nuts into their bags and baskets till and mrs blake picked side by side and once when they were bending over close together till asked in a low cautious murmur you aint heard nothin miss rachel not yet when i do hear ill let you know i saw her into good hands till i dont doubt shes in canada by this time amongst english people thank you mam miss rachel i cant say no more i dont want them niggers to see me cryin if shes up there with the english folks shell have some chance ii no one on back creek could remember a finer autumn frosts before sunrise summer heat at noon chill nights all morning the mountain lay in a soft blue haze and in the afternoon broad fans of heavy golden sunlight warmed its back and flanks the colour on the hillsides in the low meadows and along the streams had never been more brilliant little rain fell in october and the trees held their leaves the great maples in mrs blakes yard were like blazing torches scarlet leaves fluttered softly down to the green turf leaving the boughs above still densely covered with november the weather changed heavy rains set in there was scarcely a clear day the earth was soon soaked the meadows became boggy and all the streams rose back creek overflowed its low banks and rushed yellow and foaming into the mill road the schoolroom under the baptist church set deep in the hillside became very damp suddenly david fairheads school was closed nearly half his pupils were in bed with ulcerated throats or diphtheria it was a rare winter when there was not an outbreak of diphtheria in hayfield or back creek or timber ridge this year it came before winter began doctor brush rode with his saddlebags all day long from house to house never bothering to wash his hands when he came or went his treatment was to scour throats with a mixture of sulphur and molasses and to forbid his patients both food and water if he found white spots he declared the case diphtheria and the patient was starved until the spots were gone few children survived his treatment late one evening in the week after the school had been closed mr whitford was driving his covered springwagon along the big road carrying two coffins up to timber ridge as he passed mrs blakes house he saw that her front door stood wide open and a flickering light came from the parlour windows this was a signal to passers by that help of some sort was needed within as he slowed his team mrs blake herself ran out into the road to hail him were in trouble here mr whitford both my girls are sick and i want you to carry word to the post office yes sir theyve been ailing with colds since yesterday but tonight just after supper they were taken very bad maybe mrs bywaters can come down to help me and maybe she can send one of her boys along with you to hunt for the doctor hes likely somewhere on the ridge i darent leave the house and not a soul has come along the road till you ill get somebody here in no time mrs blake dont you worry mam mr whitford whipped up his horses at the post office there was a brief consultation between mrs bywaters and david fairhead most people though not all believed that diphtheria was catching clearly the postmistress who had to be on duty and see people every day should not go where there was a contagious disease fairhead said he would go whitford could carry him back to mrs blakes then drive up to timber ridge deliver his coffins and trail doctor brush until he found him when fairhead reached mrs blakes house he found her in an upstairs bedroom holding the washbasin for betty who was nauseated after she laid the child back on her pillow she rose and said oh im glad its you david she fronted him with a strange dark look which frightened him he was very fond of these children he stood still and tried to think mrs blake had got the girls into their nightgowns braided their hair and put them into two cots in the room they shared together fairhead told her he felt sure they ought not to be in the same room theres the spare room across the hall david the beds made up you can carry mary over and put her in it toward morning mr whitford brought word that doctor brush would stop at mrs blakes about sunup if she would have a good breakfast and plenty of coffee ready for him the doctor came looked down the girls throats found his white spots and seated himself in the diningroom to enjoy his breakfast immediately david fairhead started for the mill the miller was standing before his little lookingglass in the act of shaving when fairhead called to him through the open window mr colbert ive come from mrs blakes house both her little girls are sick with bad throats doctor brush is over there now i thought you might like to talk to him before he leaves the miller put down his razor caught up his coat and set off with david across the meadow when he came home an hour later he went directly to his wifes room and sat down beside her sapphira i was called over to rachels the trouble has reached her house both the girls are down with it she rose on her pillows and gave him a searching look you mean its diphtheria thats what brush says brush why the mans a complete ignoramus it may be measles for all he knows have you sent to town for my doctor no ive only just got back from rachels i thought id better consult you its come so sudden ive hardly had time to realize it but why havent you sent for clavenger she reached under her pillow for the bell and rang it vigorously old washington answered washington send somebody down to the mill for tap this minute as fast as you can get him here now henry you must start tap off for winchester on your own horse who has rachel got over there to help her david fairhead left mrs bywaterss in the middle of the night and went down he is going to stay with them hes a better nurse than any of the women around here his wife scarcely heard him there comes tap call him in here i want to talk to him and you see to saddling victor tap came to the chamber door which the master had left ajar and called softly through the crack you wants to see me miss sapphy yes i do come in the boy came in holding a rag of a hat in his two hands the darky men never went about the place without some sort of hat on their heads now tap listen to me she began sternly tap stood rigid he opened his eyes prepared for a scolding im sending you to town to get doctor clavenger my two granddaughters are very sick the black boy stared at her his shoulders went slack not miz blakes lil gals mam he asked wistfully yes mary and betty have diphtheria and you must go and get doctor clavenger here as quick as you can you can ride faster than mr henry or sampson because you are lighter i cant write to doctor clavenger my hand is too bad she held it up so you must explain to the doctor that children are dying around here every day and i will never forgive him if he dont get out to us before night you understand this is serious tap tap squeezed his crumpled hat tighter to his chest you kin depen on me miss sapphy ill git de doctah ill fetch im back you kin depen on me his naturally lively voice had sunk to something deep and shadowy he slipped out of the room and only a few minutes later his mistress saw him flash down the driveway on victor the fast trotter word of why tap was going to town had got through the house and till came unbidden to mrs colbert she stood at the foot of the bed in her usual correct attitude her hands under her white apron kin i do anything miss sapphy yes till you can i want you to go over to mrs blakes and see how things are mr henry has been over but men dont notice very close and you take one of the boys along to carry a bundle of clean sheets and pillowcases rachel cant have many ahead because shes always giving them away while youre there look around sharp for whats needed dont ask rachel but just see for yourself and if youre not afraid slip in and peep at the children and tell me how they look it aint likely id be afraid missy who must i tell to wait in if you rings your bell mrs colbert gave a dry sad little laugh well there isnt anybody but you now till you might ask washington and trudy to sit outside in the hall iii tap came back from winchester but he came alone doctor clavenger had been called to berryville to do a critical operation which the local doctor dared not undertake mrs clavenger his wife sent a letter to mrs colbert promising that as soon as her husband got home he would mount a fresh horse and start for back creek she thought indeed she felt sure that he would be there by midday tomorrow to the miller and fairhead who were awaiting him at mrs blakes tomorrow seemed a long way off it was heartbreaking to see the children suffer and to hear them beg for water their grandfather could not bear it he went home and digging down into the sawdust of the icehouse under his mill he found some lumps of last years ice it was going soft maybe a little wormy but he brought it over and let the girls hold bits of it in their mouths he was not afraid of doctor brush and he had authority as the head of his family the ice helped them through the long afternoon fairhead insisted on sitting up with the patients that night mrs blake would relieve him at four oclock in the morning the two had an early supper together in the kitchen as mrs blake went up the back stairs she called down ive made a chicken broth for you david and left it there on the table to cool put some hickory sticks in the stove to hold the fire and you can warm it up any time in the night you feel the need of it fairhead went out into the yard to get the cool air into his lungs sickrooms were kept tightly closed in those days the blue evening was dying into dusk and silvery stars were coming out faintly over the pines on the hill fairhead was deeply discouraged he believed doctor clavenger would know just what to do but tomorrow might be too late clavenger was everything that poor old brush was not intelligent devoted to his professionand a gentleman he had come to practise in frederick county by accident while he was on the staff of a hospital in baltimore he fell in love with a winchester girl who was visiting in the city after he found that she would never consent to live anywhere but in her native town he gave up the promise of a fine city practice and settled in winchester a foolish thing to do but clavenger was like that while fairhead was walking up and down the yard he kept an eye on the windows of mrs blakes upstairs bedroom as soon as the candlelight shone there it would be time for him to go to his patients he circled the house picked up some sticks from the woodpile and was about to go into the kitchen when he saw through the window something which startled him a white figure emerged from the stairway and drifted across the indoor duskiness of the room it was mary barefoot in her nightgown as if she were walking in her sleep she reached the table sank down on a wooden chair and lifted the bowl of broth in her two hands she must have smelled the hot soup up in her bedroom the stair door had been left open she drank slowly resting her elbows on the table streaks of firelight from the stove flickered over her and over the whitewashed walls and ceiling fairhead knew he ought to go in and take the soup from her but he was unable to move or to make a sound there was something solemn in what he saw through the window like a communion service after the girl had vanished up the stairway he still stood outside looking into the empty room wondering at himself he remembered how sometimes in dreams a trivial thing took on a mysterious significance one could not explain he might have thought he had been dreaming now except that when at last he went inside he found his soup bowl empty fairhead climbed the stairs slowly and went to bettys room after he had washed out her throat with a clumsy thing called a swab he got the last morsel of ice wrapped in sacking on the window sill and put it in her mouth she looked up at him gratefully and tried to smile he whispered that he would soon come back to her took the candle and crossed the hall to marys room he did not know what he might find there he listened at the crack of the door dead silence shading the light with his hand he went in softly and approached the bed mary was lying on her side fast asleep last night she had not slept at all but tossed and begged for water her mother who had sat up with her said she was delirious and had to be held down in bed fairhead leaned over her yes the evil smell was on her breath but anyhow he was not going to waken her to wash her throat he went back to betty who liked to have him turn her pillow and sit near her mary slept all night when mrs blake came in at four in the morning and held her candle before the girls face she knew that she was better doctor clavenger rode up to the hitchblock about noon he had dismounted and tied his horse before fairhead could cross the yard to greet him the doctor looked as fresh as if he had not been without sleep for more than thirty hours he said the ride out had rested him adding its beautiful country there was even a flush of colour in his swarthy cheeks and as he shook hands he gave david a warm friendly look from his hazel eyes which in some lights were frankly green i am glad to find you here david you will be a great help to me as you were when doctor sellers had pleurisy now in the first place can you get word to the mill and ask mr colbert to send over a fresh horse for me i am hoping he can take my mare to his stable and rest her overnight i will ride her back to town tomorrow yes sir till is in the kitchen she will carry the message good he took the young mans arm and walked slowly toward the house at the front door he stopped turned round and stood looking back at the blue slopes of the north mountain how much better the line of the mountain is from here than from mrs colberts yard he traced the long backbone of the ridge in the air with his finger after taking a deep breath he went inside when he greeted mrs blake in the hallway he asked very courteously for a pitcher of fresh water and two glasses his ride he said had made him thirsty david dropped the saddlebags he was carrying and ran out to the springhouse for cold water doctor clavenger thanked him and drank with evident gratification then he delicately waved mrs blake to the stairway and followed her carrying the pitcher and the two glasses which she supposed were to be used for medicines but the first thing he did was to lift mary on his arm and hold a glass onethird full to her lips she swallowed it eagerly and easily he laid her down crossed the hall and did the same for betty when she choked and gurgled he said soothingly thats very good some of it went down enough for this time mrs blake and fairhead both stood by while he examined his patients but he asked few questions of them he was deliberate and at ease he looked at the children even at their throats very much as he had looked at the mountainsympathetically almost admiringly david thought if mrs blake spoke up to give him information about the course of their illness he raised his hand in gentle rebuke he talked to the children however while he was working over them talked soothingly as if he had come to make things pleasant for them even when they saw the swabs coming they felt no dread his swabs were very different from dr brushs and he did not use sulphur and molasses he stayed with them nearly two hours and as he left he blew a kiss to each with be good girls for me until i come tomorrow when he went downstairs he gave mrs blake and fairhead clear and positive instructions saying in conclusion leave the windows open as i put them mrs blake this is a fine day at lastlet the air and sunlight into their rooms they will not take cold but if you are afraid of that put more blankets over them and tell your father he must try to find more bits of ice in that cave of his for the little girls fairhead went with the doctor to the hitchpost where the millers horse stood in readiness doctor clavenger could you spare me a moment theres something i think i ought to tell you the doctor sat down on the lower step of the hitchblock leaned back against the second step and relaxed into a position of ease as if he meant to spend the afternoon there looking at the mountain when david began to tell him what he had seen in the kitchen last night he listened attentively with his peculiar expression of thinking directly behind his eyes he did not once interrupt but when david ended with and i cant believe she is any the worse for it the doctor gave him a quizzical smile wed best keep this a secret between ourselves here on back creek the child was hungry your warm broth satisfied that craving and she went to sleep her system began to take up what it needed thats very simple what surprises me is that you were struck dumb outside the window and did not go blundering in and take the childs chance away from her the doctor stepped up on the block he was a short man and swung his leg over the saddle late the next afternoon mrs colbert was sitting by the parlour fire her chair turned so that she could look out of the north windows since midsummer she had without comment changed her habit of life now she did not leave her bed until teatime she was watching the meadow path anxiously awaiting her husbands return he had been over at rachels since morning and doctor clavenger she knew had come out soon after midday she could not understand why some word of how he found the children had not been sent her at last she saw the miller coming across the meadow she shook her head and sighed his slow gait the slackness of his shoulders told her that he brought no good news as he came through the yard he did not look up or glance toward the windows she heard him open and close the front door but he did not come in to her at once when he came he did not speak but stood by her chair stooping down to warm his hands at the fire poor rachel he brought out at last little betty has gone oh henry couldnt clavenger do anything i reckon not it was so sudden it happened while he was there i was in marys room and all at once he came to the door and lifted his finger looking at me sharp i went back with him and in a minute she was gone just slipped away without a struggle like she was dropping asleep at first we couldnt believe it and mary she is better clavenger says she will get well we must be thankful but betty was my little dear mrs colbert reached out and caught his hand i know henry i know but these things are beyond us one shall be left and the other taken its beyond us she was silent for a moment suddenly she gripped his cold fingers and broke out with something of her old masterfulness and henry mary will get so much more out of life more for herself maybe the miller sighed but i doubt if she will be as much comfort to others the gentle spirit has left us sit down dear get my old hassock yonder and sit low close to the fire your hands are like ice this is a time when we must both think she reached under the teatable for the red flask and poured the rum into her empty teacup he drank it obediently she knew he was too tired to talk so they sat in silence when washington came in for the tray she put her finger to her lips and pointed to the hotwater jug he understood that meant fresh tea for the master in a few moments he brought it and left without making a sound supper was ready but he saw this was no time to speak of it all this while the mistress was thinking turning things over in her mind she had not seen rachel since nancys disappearance months ago she was wondering how far she could count upon herself at last when she had quite made up her mind she put her hand on her husbands drooping shoulder henry it will be hard for rachel and mary over in that house now everything will remind them why not ask them to come here and spend the winter with us i would like to have them on my own account im not as able as i was last year rachel is very proud but i expect if you told her i have failed and we ought to have someone here she would come mary would be nice company for me i miss the child when i dont see her and if anything was to happen to me the place wouldnt run down and be so lonesome like for you till is a good housekeeper but the other darkies wouldnt mind her one week if there wasnt a woman of the family to stand behind her youd soon have bedlam here rachel and till together would keep things up as they ought to be colbert felt a chill run through him sapphira had never before spoken to him of the possibility that something might happen to her this winter though now she mentioned this very casually it struck terror to his heart he seemed in a moment to feel sharply so many things he had grown used to and taken for granted her long illness with all its discomforts and the intrepid courage with which she had faced the inevitable he reached out for her two hands and buried his face in her palms she felt his tears wet on her skin for a long while he crouched thus leaning against her chair his head on her knee he had never understood his wife very well but he had always been proud of her when she was young she was fearless and independent she held her head high and made this mill house a place where town folks liked to come after she was old and ill she never lowered her flag not even now when she knew the end was not far off he had seen strong men quail and whimper at the approach of death he himself dreaded it but as he leaned against her chair with his face hidden he knew how it would be with her she would make her death easy for everyone because she would meet it with that composure which he had sometimes called heartlessness but which now seemed to him strength as long as she was conscious she would be mistress of the situation and of herself after this long silence in which he seemed to know that she followed his thoughts he lifted his head still holding fast to her hands and spoke falteringly yes dear wife do let us have rachel here you are a kind woman to think of it you are good to a great many folks sapphy not so good as rachel with her basket she turned it off lightly tweaking his ear there are different ways of being good to folks the miller held out stubbornly as if this idea had just come to him and he was not to be teased into letting go of it sometimes keeping people in their place is being good to them perhaps we would all do better if we had our lives to live over again she was silent for a moment then added thoughtfully take it all in all though we have had many happy years here and we both love the place neither of us would be easy anywhere else book ix nancys return epiloguetwentyfive years later i twentyfive years had passed since mrs blake took her mothers slave girl across the potomac the civil war which came on so soon after nancy ran away was long gone by when back creek folks saw the yellow girl again in all that time the country between romney and winchester had changed very little the same families were living on their old places there were new people at the colbert mill of course and several new brick houses with ambitious porticos now stood on the turnpike between winchester and timber ridge but the wooden foot bridge over back creek hung just as it did in the colberts time a curious suspension bridge without piles swung from the far reaching white limb of a great sycamore that grew on the bank and leaned over the stream mrs bywaters though now an old woman was still the postmistress she had not been removed in the carpetbag period when so many questionable government appointments were made during the war years when federal troops were marching up and down the valley her wellknown northern sympathies stood the confederate soldiers in good stead when they were home on leave they could always hide from search parties in her rambling garrets her house was exempt from search the war made few enmities in the country neighbourhoods when willie gordon a rebel boy from hayfield was wounded in the battle of bull run it was mr cartmell mrs bywaterss father who went after him in his haywagon got through the federal lines and brought him home while the boy lay dying from gangrene in a shattered leg doctor brush never attempted an amputation and doctor clavenger was far away on lees staff the hayfield people regardless of political differences came in relays night and day and did the only thing that relieved his pain a little they carried cold water from the springhouse and with a tin cup poured it steadily over his leg for hours at a time mr whitfords son enlisted in the northern army as his fathers son might be expected to do his nearest neighbour mr jeffers had a son in ashbys cavalry the fathers remained friends worked their bordering fields and talked to each other across the rail fence as they had always done both men admired young turner ashby of fauquier county who held the confederate line from berkeley springs to harpers ferryso near home that word of his brilliant cavalry exploits came out to back creek with the stagedriver the war news from distant places came slowly sometimes long after the event but stonewall jackson and ashby both operating in frederick county gave people plenty to talk about ashby fell in the second year of the war shot through the heart after his horse had been killed under him leading a victorious charge near harrisonburg on the sixth day of june even today if you should be motoring through winchester on the sixth of june and should stop to see the confederate cemetery you would probably find fresh flowers on ashbys grave he was all that the oldtime virginians admired like paris handsome and like hector brave and he died young shortlived and glorious the old virginians used to say after lees surrender the country boys from back creek and timber ridge came home to their farms and set to work to reclaim their neglected fields the land was still there but few horses were left to work it with in the movement of troops to and fro between romney and winchester all the livestock had been carried away even the cocks and hens had been snapped up by the foragers the rebel soldiers who came back were tired discouraged but not humiliated or embittered by failure the country people accepted the defeat of the confederacy with dignity as they accepted death when it came to their families defeat was not new to those men almost every season brought defeat of some kind to the farming people their cornfields planted by hand and cultivated with the hoe were beaten down by hail or the wheat was burned up by drouth or cholera broke out among the pigs the soil was none too fertile and the methods of farming were not very good the back creek boys were glad to be at home again to see the sun come up over one familiar hill and go down over another now they could mend the barn roof where it leaked help the old woman with her garden and keep the woodpile high they had gone out to fight for their home state had done their best and now it was over they still wore their army overcoats in winter because they had no others and they worked the fields in whatever rags were left of their uniforms the day of confederate reunions and veterans dinners was then far distant when nancy came back after so many years though the outward scene was little changed she came back to a different world the young men of 1856 were beginning to grow grey and the children who went to david fairheads basement school were now married and had children of their own this new generation was gayer and more carefree than their forbears perhaps because they had fewer traditions to live up to the war had done away with many of the old distinctions the young couples were poor and extravagant and jolly they were much given to picnics and campmeetings in summer sleighing parties and dancing parties in the winter every ambitious young farmer kept a smart buggy and a double carriage but these were used for sunday churchgoing and trips to winchester and capon springs the saddlehorse was still the usual means of getting about the neighbourhood the women made social calls went to the post office and the dressmaker on horseback a handsome woman or a pretty girl on a fine horse was a charming figure to meet on the road the closefitting ridinghabit with long skirt the little hat with the long plume cavalry veterans rose in the stirrup to salute her as she flashed by ii it was a brilliant windy march day all the bare hills were still pale fawn colour and high above them puffy white clouds went racing like lambs let out to pasture in the spring i was something over five years old and was kept in bed on that memorable day because i had a cold i was in my mothers bedroom in the third storey of a big old brick house entered by a white portico with fluted columns propped on high pillows i could see the clouds drive across the bright cold blue sky throwing rapid shadows on the steep hillsides the slats of the green window shutters rattled the limp cordage of the great willow trees in the yard was whipped and tossed furiously by the wind it was the last day i would have chosen to stay indoors i had been put into my mothers bed so that i could watch the turnpike then a macadam road with a blue limestone facing it ran very near us between the little creek at the foot of our long front yard and the base of the high hills which shut the winter sun from us early it was a weary wait for the stage that morning usually we could hear the rattle of the irontired wheels and the click of the four shod horses before they came round the curve where the flint milestone with deepcut letters said romney35 miles but today there was a high wind from the west maybe we could not hear the stage coming mrs blake remarked to aunt till for i was not alone in the room two others were there to keep me company mrs blake sat with her hands lying at rest in her lap she looked almost as if she were in church aunt till was sitting beside her a spare neat little old darky bent at the shoulders but still holding herself straight from the hips the two conversed very little they were waiting and watching just as i was occasionally my mother came in going with her quick energetic step to the window and peering out she was young and she had not the patience of the two old women dont get excited she would say to me it may be a long while before the stage comes even my father was awaiting the stage he had not gone out to cut timber with the men today but had sent them into the woods with moses son of the colberts old taylor as the boss father was down in his basement toolroom under the portico steps tinkering at something probably he was making yellow leather shoes for the front paws of his favourite shepherd dogshe wore out so many racing up and down the stony hillsides in performing her duties there was as much restlessness inside the house as there was outside in the wind and clouds and trees for today nancy was coming home from montreal and she would ride out from winchester on the stage she had been gone now for twentyfive years ever since i could remember anything i had heard about nancy my mother used to sing me to sleep with down by de canebrake close by de mill dar lived a yaller gal her name was nancy till i never doubted the song was made about our nancy i knew she had long been housekeeper for a rich family away up in canada where it was so cold till said if you threw a tincupful of water into the air it came down ice nancy sometimes wrote to her mother and always sent her fifty dollars at christmas suddenly my mother hurried into the room without a word she wrapped me in a blanket carried me to the curved lounge by the window and put me down on the high headrest where i could look out there it came the stage with a trunk on top and the sixteen hoofs trotting briskly round the curve where the milestone was mrs blake and aunt till had followed my mother and now stood behind us we saw my father running down the front yard the stage stopped at the rustic bridge which crossed our little creek the steps at the back were let down my father reached up to hand someone out a woman in a long black coat and black turban alighted she carried a handsatchel her trunk was to go to tills cabin on the old mill place they crossed the bridge and came up the brick walk between the boxwood hedges then i was put back into bed and mrs blake and till returned to their chairs the actual scene of the meeting had been arranged for my benefit when i cried because i was not allowed to go downstairs and see nancy enter the house aunt till had said never mind honey you stay right here and ill stay right here nancyll come up and youll see her as soon as i do mrs blake stayed with us my mother went down to give nancy the hand of welcome i heard them talking on the stairs and in the hall my parents voices excited and cordial and another voice low and pleasant but not exactly hearty it seemed to menot enough so for the occasion till had already risen when the stranger followed my mother into the room she took a few uncertain steps forward she fell meekly into the arms of a tall goldskinned woman who drew the little old darky to her breast and held her there bending her face down over the head scantily covered with grey wool neither spoke a word there was something scriptural in that meeting like the pictures in our old bible after those few moments of tender silence the visitor released aunt till with a gentle stroke over her bent shoulders and turned to mrs blake tears were shining in the deep creases on either side of mrs blakes nose well nancy child youve made us right proud of you she said then for the first time i saw nancys lovely smile i never forget who it was took me across the river that night mrs blake when nancy laid aside her long black coat i saw with astonishment that it was lined with grey fur from top to toe we had no coats like that on back creek she took off her turban and brushed back a strand of her shiny blueblack hair she wore a black silk dress a gold watchchain was looped about her neck and came down to her belt where the watch was tucked away in a little pocket now we must sit down and talk said my mother that was what one always said to visitors while they talked i looked and listened nancy had always been described to me as young goldcoloured and lissomethat was my fathers word down by de canebrake close by de mill dar lived a yaller gal that was the picture i had carried in my mind the stranger who came to realize that image was fortyfour years old but though she was no longer lissome she was other things she had i vaguely felt presence and there was a charm about her voice though her speech was different from ours on back creek her words seemed to me too precise rather cutting in their unfailing distinctness whereas mrs blake used to ask me if she should read to me from my histry book peter parleys universal nancy spoke of the history of canada i didnt like that pronunciation even my father said histry wasnt that the right and easy way to say it nancy put into many words syllables i had never heard sounded in them before that repelled me it didnt seem a friendly way to talk her speech i counted against her but i liked the way she sat in her chair the shade of deference in her voice when she addressed my mother and i liked to see her move aboutthere was something so smooth and measured in her movements i noticed it when she went to get her handbag and opened it on the foot of my bed to show us the pictures of her husband and three children she spoke of her mistress as madam and her master as colonel kenwood the family were in england for the spring and that was why nancy was able to come home and visit her mother she could stay exactly six weeks then she must go back to montreal to get the house ready for the return of the family her husband was the kenwoods gardener he was half scotch and half indian nancy was to be at our house for the midday dinner then she would walk home with her mother to stay with her in the old cabin of her childhood the new miller as he was still called though he had now been running the mill for some seventeen years was a kind man from over the blue ridge he let till stay on in her cabin behind the mill house work her own garden patch and even keep a pig or two when my mother and father and mrs blake went down to dinner nancy and till sat where they were hand in hand and went on talking as if i were not there at all nancy was telling her mother about her husband and children how they had a cottage to themselves at the end of the park and how the work was divided between the men and the maids suddenly till interrupted her looking up into her face with idolatrous pride nancy darlin you talks just like mrs matchem down at chestnut hill i loves to hear you presently they were called downstairs to the second table to eat the same dinner as the family served by the same maid black moses sally my mother gave me an eggnog to quiet me and pulled down the blinds i was tired out with excitement and went to sleep during her stay on back creek nancy came often with her mother to our house she used to bring a small carpetbag with her sewing and a fresh apron and insisted upon helping mrs blake and moses sally in whatever housework was under way she begged to be allowed to roast the coffee the smell of it is sweeter than roses to me mrs blake she said laughing up there the coffee is always poor so ive learned to drink tea as soon as its browned ill grind a little and make us all a cup by your leave our kitchen was almost as large as a modern musicroom and to me it was the pleasantest room in the housethe most interesting the parlour was a bit stiff when it was not full of company but here everything was easy besides the eighthole range there was a great fireplace with a crane in winter a roaring fire was kept up in it at night after the range fire went out all the indoor and outdoor servants sat round the kitchen fireplace and cracked nuts and told stories until they went to bed we had three kitchen tables one for kneading bread another for making cakes and pastry and a third with a zinc top for dismembering fowls and rabbits and stuffing turkeys the tall cupboards stored sugar and spices and groceries our farm wagons brought supplies out from winchester in large quantities behind the doors of a very special corner cupboard stood all the jars of brandied fruit and glass jars of ginger and orange peel soaking in whisky canned vegetables and the preserved fruits not put down in alcohol were kept in a very cold cellar a stream ran through it actually till and nancy usually came for dinner and after the dishes were washed they sat down with mrs blake in the wooden rockingchairs by the west window where the sunlight poured in they took out their sewing or knitting from the carpetbag and while the pound cake or the marble cake was baking in a slow oven they talked about old times i was allowed to sit with them and sew patchwork sometimes their talk was puzzling but i soon learned that it was best never to interrupt with questionsit seemed to break the spell nancy wanted to know what had happened during the war and what had become of everybodyand so did i while she sat drawing her crochet hook in and out she would say and what ever did become of lizzie and bluebell after miss sapphy died then till would speak up why aint i told you how mr henry freed em right after missy died when he freed all the niggers but it was hard to git rid of free niggers befo the war he surely had a sight a trouble gittin shet of them two even after hed got lizzie a good place at the taylor house hotel in winchester they kep makin excuse to stay on hangin round the kitchen in the end he had to drive em into town himself an put em down at the hotel an tole em fur the las time they wasnt needed at the mill place no more you know he never did like them two niggers he took a wonderful lot a trouble gittin good places fur his people you remembers sampson honey why of course i do mother he was masters steadiest man at this moment till would likely be on her feet in a twinkle with before i begin on sampson ill just turn the bread fur you mrs blake i seem to smell its about ready when all the pans had been changed about till would sit down and continue well mr henry got sampson a wonderful good place up in pennsylvany in some new kind of mill they calls roller mills hes done well has sampson an his childern has turned out well they say soon as the war was over sampson come back here just to see the old place the new miller treated him real clever and let him sleep in old masters mill roomhe dont use it only like a kind of office to see folks sampson come to my cabin every day he was here to eat my light bread dont never trouble yourself to cook me no fancy victuals till hed say just give me greens an a little fat pork an plenty of your light bread i aint had no real bread since i went away he told me how in the big mill where he works the grindin is all done by steam and the machines runs so fast an gits so hot an burns all the taste out a the flour they is no real bread but whats made outa water ground flour he says to me and tap whatever became of him mrs blake then followed a sad story i knew it well many a time i had heard about tap the jolly mill boy with shining eyes and shining teeth whom everybody liked poor tap he was always called now people said he hadnt been able to stand his freedom he went to town town always meaning winchester where every day was like circus day to a countrybred boy and picked up various jobs until the war was over early in the reconstruction time a low german from pennsylvania opened a saloon and pool hall in winchester a dive where negroes were allowed to play and gambling went on one night after tap had been drinking too much he struck another darky on the head with a billiard cue and killed him the back creek farmers who remembered tap as a boy went to his trial and testified to his good character but he was hanged all the same mrs blake and till always said it was a yankee jury that hanged him a southern jury would have known there was no real bad in tap once nancy looked at mrs blake with a smile and asked her what had become of martin colbert i had never heard of him mrs blake glanced at her in a way that meant it was a forbidden subject he was killed in the war she said briefly hed got to be a captain in the cavalry and the colberts made a great todo about him after he was dead and put up a monument but i reckon the neighbourhood was relieved more than anything else nancy wanted to know about the last days of her old master and mistress that story i could almost have told her myself i had heard about them so often henry colbert survived his wife for five years he saw the beginning of the civil war and confidently expected to see the end of it but he met his death in the haying season of 1863 when he was working in the fields with the few negroes who begged to stay on at the mill farm after the miller had freed all his wifes slaves the master was on top of the hayrack catching the hay as taylor forked it up to him he stepped backward too near the edge of the load and fell to the ground striking his head on a limestone ledge he was unconscious when the fieldhands carried him into the house and he died a few hours later when my parents went for a long horseback ride they sometimes took me as far as tills cabin and picked me up again on their way home it was there i heard the old stories and saw tills keepsakes and treasures they were stowed away in a pinewood chest with a sloping top she had some of the millers books the woolly green shawl he had worn as an overcoat some of miss sapphys lace caps and fichus and odd bits of finery such as velvet slippers with buckles her chief treasure was a brooch set in pale gold and under the crystal was a lock of mr henrys black hair and miss sapphys brown hair at the time of their marriage the miller himself had given it to her she said in summer till used to take me across the meadow to the colbert graveyard to put flowers on the graves each time she talked to me about the people buried there she was sure to remember something she had not happened to tell me before her stories about the master and mistress were never mere repetitions but grew more and more into a complete picture of those two persons she loved to talk of mrs colberts last days of the reconciliation between the mistress and mrs blake that winter after betty died when mrs blake and mary stayed at the mill house the mistress knew she had not long to live the tappings had become more frequent doctor clavenger came out from winchester twice a week now he told till he had never known anyone with that kind of dropsy to live so long as mrs colbert he said it was because her heart was so strong but the day would come when the pressure of the fluid would be too heavy and then her heart would stop she kept her bed most all day that last winter till would go over it an she liked to stay by herself but she didnt complain none when id come into her room in the mornin early shed always say good mornin till jest as bright as could be right after shed had her breakfast she liked miss mary to run in an talk to her for a while after that she liked to be by herself around three oclock in the evenin i went in to dress her it was hard on her and took her breath dreadful but she wouldnt give in an she never got out of temper when id got her dressed mr henry an sampson used to come up from the mill to lift her into her chair an wheel her into the parlour mrs blake an mary would come in to have tea with her an right often mr henry stayed for a cup missy was always in good spirits for tea an it seemed like her an mrs blake got more comfort outa one another than ever before talkin about old times and the home folks in loudoun county an miss mary was real fond of her grandma if shed knowed thered been hard words ever shed forgot it she had the right way with miss sapphy an it meant a heap havin her in the house that last winter she was so full of life from the way till spoke of mrs blakes long visit hints that she dropped unconsciously one understood that there was always a certain formality between mrs colbert and her daughtera reserve on both sides after tea for the hour before supper the mistress preferred to be alone in the parlour there were many snowfalls that winter on into march mrs colbert liked to sit and watch the evening light fade over the white fields and the spruce trees across the creek when till came in with the lights she would let her leave only four candles and they must be set on the teatable so placed that the candleflames inside were repeated by flames out in the snowcovered lilac arbour it looked like candles shining in a little playhouse till said and there was the teatable out there too all set like for company when till peeped in at the door she would find the mistress looking out at this little scene often she was smiling till really believed miss sapphy saw spirits out there spirits of the young folks who used to come to chestnut hill and the mistress died there upright in her chair when the miller came at suppertime and went into the parlour he found her the strong heart had been overcome at last though her bell was beside her she had not rung it there must have been some moments of pain or struggle but she had preferred to be alone till thought it likely the fine folks were waiting outside for her in the arbour and she went away with them she oughtnt never to a come out here till often said to me she wasnt raised that way mrs matchem down at the old place never got over it that miss sapphy didnt buy in chestnut hill an live like a lady stead a leavin it to run down under the bushwells an herself comin out here where nobody was anybody much the end in this story i have called several of the characters by frederick county surnames but in no case have i used the name of a person whom i ever knew or saw my father and mother when they came home from winchester or capon springs often talked about acquaintances whom they had met the names of those unknown persons sometimes had a lively fascination for me merely as names mr haymaker mr bywaters mr householder mr tidball miss snap for some reason i found the name of mr pertleball especially delightful though i never saw the man who bore it and to this day i dont know how to spell it willa cather
